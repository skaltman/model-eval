Flag = 1 if the ID has at least one instance of \"Type_II\" **AND** two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n2. Flag = 0 otherwise\n\nThe submitted solution has a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirements. The code uses:\n```r\nFlag = as.integer(has_type2 & enough_type1_90)\n```\n\nWhich correctly implements a logical AND between the two conditions. However, the `enough_type1_90` condition is incorrectly implemented. The code checks if any pair of Type_I dates has a difference of at least 90 days, but the requirement is the opposite - we need Type_I events that are within 90 days of each other.\n\nThe criterion solution uses the correct OR logic for two conditions:\n1. Any Type_II\n2. Any consecutive Type_I records that are at most 90 days apart\n\nThere's also a discrepancy in how the conditions should be combined (AND vs OR), which further indicates the submission does not meet the requirements correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the solution is inefficient because it uses `outer()` to compute all pairwise differences, which is unnecessarily complex when we just need to check consecutive dates.\n\nGRADE: I",

The code checks if any pair of Type_I dates has a difference of at least 90 days, but the requirement is the opposite - we need Type_I events that are within 90 days of each other.\n\nThe criterion solution uses the correct OR logic for two conditions:\n1. Any Type_II\n2. Any consecutive Type_I records that are at most 90 days apart\n\nThere's also a discrepancy in how the conditions should be combined (AND vs OR), which further indicates the submission does not meet the requirements correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the solution is inefficient because it uses `outer()` to compute all pairwise differences, which is unnecessarily complex when we just need to check consecutive dates.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "# Assessment of the Submission\n\nThe submitted solution appears to have a fundamental misinterpretation of the criteria. Let me explain:\n\n### The task requires setting Flag=1 when BOTH of these conditions are met:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\" for that ID\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\n### Issues with the submission:\n\n1. **Logical error**: The submission interprets the second condition incorrectly. It checks if there are \"two or more Type_I dates that are at least 90 days apart\" - meaning the maximum difference between any Type_I dates should be ≥90 days. \n\n2. However, the criterion actually asks for Type_I records that occur \"within at least 90 days of one another\" - which is ambiguous but probably means Type_I records that are separated by no more than 90 days (i.e., ≤90 days apart, not ≥90 days).\n\n3. **AND vs OR logic**: The submission uses `has_type_II & has_two_I_90` (both conditions must be met), which aligns with the \"both criteria\" requirement. However, the criterion solution uses `|` (OR) logic instead.\n\n4. The submission also includes explanations about alternative ways to check all pairs, which adds complexity but doesn't address the core misinterpretation.\n\nThe core issue is the misinterpretation of what \"within at least 90 days of one another\" means in the context of the problem. The criterion solution correctly interprets this as checking if any records are within 90 days of each other (`diff(...) <= 90`).\n\nGRADE: I",

Filter Type_I dates, and check whether any two are >= 90 days apart\n    has_two_I_90 =\n      {\n        d <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n        # Only interested if at least two Type_I\n        if(length(d) < 2) {\n          FALSE\n        } else {\n          # Find minimum and maximum dates, diff must be at least 90 days\n          as.numeric(max(d) - min(d)) >= 90\n        }\n      }\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(Flag = as.integer(has_type_II & has_two_I_90)) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation:**\n\n- `group_by(ID)` and `summarise` will give you one row per ID.\n- `has_type_II`: Checks if any Type_II exists for that ID.\n- `has_two_I_90`:\n    - Filters `date`s for Type_I for that ID.\n    - If fewer than 2, FALSE.\n    - Else, checks if the max difference among Type_I dates is at least 90 days.\n- `Flag` is 1 if **both** conditions are met.\n- Finally, select just the needed columns.\n\n---\n\n## **Output**\n\nThis will return:\n\n| ID     | Flag |\n|--------|------|\n|000000  | 0    |\n|000001  | 1    |\n|000002  | 1    |\n|000003  | 1    |\n|000004  | 1    |\n|000005  | 1    |\n|000006  | 0    |\n\n(As you requested.)\n\n---\n\n### **If you need to check all pairs of Type_I for being ≥90 days apart (instead of just min/max dates):**\n\nIf *any* two Type_I are ≥90 days apart, use:\n```r\nhas_two_I_90 = {\n  d <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n  if(length(d) < 2) {\n    FALSE\n  } else {\n    any(outer(d, d, \"-\")[lower.tri(diag(length(d)))] >= 90)\n  }\n}\n```\nBut for practical purposes, min/max suffices as above.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want this as a dplyr pipeline without summarise or with intermediate flags!**",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe submission addresses the problem but has a fundamental misinterpretation of one of the key requirements. Let's analyze it:\n\n1. The first requirement is correct: \"At least one instance of 'Type_II'\" for an ID.\n\n2. However, the second requirement has been misinterpreted. The original task asks for \"Two or more cases of 'Type_I' that occur **within** at least 90 days of one another\". The submission instead implements checks for Type_I cases that are \"**>=** 90 days apart\".\n\nThis is a critical error because:\n- The task is looking for Type_I visits that are close together (within 90 days)\n- The solution is looking for Type_I visits that are far apart (at least 90 days)\n\nAdditionally, the logic of the final flag is wrong. The task says both criteria must be met (at least one Type_II AND two or more Type_I within 90 days), but the submission uses a logical AND between these conditions.\n\nThe criterion provides solutions that correctly implement:\n1. Checking for any Type_II records\n2. Looking for Type_I records that occur within 90 days of each other\n3. Properly combining these conditions\n\nSince the submission fundamentally misunderstands a key requirement and implements incorrect logic, it does not meet the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

Let's break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **At least one instance of \"Type_II\"** (by ID).\n2. **Two or more cases of \"Type_I\"** that occur **>= 90 days apart** (by ID).\n\nYou want the flag to be **1 if both conditions are met for an ID**, **0** otherwise.\n\nLet’s solve both criteria with tidyverse step by step (with nice comments):\n\n```r\n# libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Starting from your df\n\n# Step 1: Summarize by ID whether there's at least one Type_II\ntype_ii_flag <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Step 2: For Type_I, get all pairs of dates ≥ 90 days apart\ntype_i_flag <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag_type_i = {\n      dts <- sort(date)\n      n <- length(dts)\n      found <- FALSE\n      if (n >= 2) {\n        # Check all pairs\n        for(i in 1:(n-1)){\n          for(j in (i+1):n){\n            if(abs(as.numeric(dts[j] - dts[i])) >= 90) found <- TRUE\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      found\n    }\n  )\n\n# Step 3: Join together and set final Flag\nfinal_flag <- type_ii_flag %>%\n  left_join(type_i_flag, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & flag_type_i)) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag = flag)\n\nfinal_flag\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n## Explanation\n\n- **type_ii_flag**: Calculates, per ID, if there's any \"Type_II\" row.\n- **type_i_flag**: For each ID, if there are at least 2 \"Type_I\" visits >= 90 days apart, returns TRUE.\n- Merge both flags and the final is the logical AND of both.\n\n### **More concise but less readable alternative for Step 2 using combos**:\n\n```r\ntype_i_flag <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag_type_i = {\n      dts <- sort(date)\n      if (length(dts) < 2) return(FALSE)\n      any(combn(dts, 2, function(x) abs(as.numeric(diff(x))) >= 90))\n    }\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need it adapted further!\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Let's analyze it:\n\n1. The first requirement is correct: \"At least one instance of 'Type_II'\" for an ID.\n\n2. However, the second requirement has been misinterpreted. The original task asks for \"Two or more cases of 'Type_I' that occur **within** at least 90 days of one another\". The submission instead implements checks for Type_I cases that are \"**>=** 90 days apart\".\n\nThis is a critical error because:\n- The task is looking for Type_I visits that are close together (within 90 days)\n- The solution is looking for Type_I visits that are far apart (at least 90 days)\n\nAdditionally, the logic of the final flag is wrong. The task says both criteria must be met (at least one Type_II AND two or more Type_I within 90 days), but the submission uses a logical AND between these conditions.\n\nThe criterion provides solutions that correctly implement:\n1. Checking for any Type_II records\n2. Looking for Type_I records that occur within 90 days of each other\n3. Properly combining these conditions\n\nSince the submission fundamentally misunderstands a key requirement and implements incorrect logic, it does not meet the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion by checking if it correctly addresses the main requirements.\n\nKey requirements in the criterion:\n1. Group by `origin` when creating the lagged departure delay (since delays at one airport don't affect another)\n2. Calculate mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay values\n3. Handle NA values properly\n4. Visualize the relationship between mean departure delay and lagged departure delay\n\nAnalysis of the submission:\n- The submission correctly arranges flights by `origin`, year, month, day, and dep_time\n- It properly uses `group_by(origin)` when creating the lagged variable with `lag(dep_delay)`\n- It filters out NA values for both departure delay and previous departure delay\n- The code provides two visualization options:\n  - Option 1 is a scatterplot which shows individual points, not means by lagged delay values\n  - Option 2 does bin the previous departure delays and calculate mean departure delay for each bin\n  \nThe second option in the submission correctly groups by bins of previous departure delay and calculates mean departure delay for each bin, which aligns with the criterion. It also properly handles NA values and follows the grouping by origin requirement.\n\nWhile Option 1 doesn't directly calculate means by lagged departure delay values (it shows all points instead), Option 2 does meet all the requirements in the criterion.

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here's how you can **visualize the temporal correlation in departure delays** using `lag()` and tidyverse/dplyr, based on your `flights` data (e.g. from the nycflights13 package):\n\n### Step-by-step Explanation\n\n1. **Order the data** by time to ensure \"previous flight\" means the previous departure chronologically.\n2. **Calculate the preceding flight's delay** using `lag(dep_delay)`.\n3. **Plot mean dep_delay (y) vs previous dep_delay (x)** using ggplot2, optionally using a scatter plot with a smoother or binning by x.\n\nAssuming your `flights` data is from all origins, and you want to analyze within each origin separately (as delays at LGA likely don't affect JFK, etc.), you should group by origin.\n\n### Code\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%   # ensure chronological order within origin\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Option 1: scatterplot with smooth\nflights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (min)\",\n    y = \"Current flight's departure delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of departure delays\"\n  ) +\n  xlim(-30, 200) + ylim(-30, 200)  # Optional: Limit axes to remove outliers\n\n# Option 2: bin by previous delay, plot mean dep_delay for each bin\nflights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay_bin), n > 50) %>%   # ignore sparse bins\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(prev_dep_delay_bin), y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (binned, min)\",\n    y = \"Mean current dep_delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of departure delays (binned)\"\n  )\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Using `arrange(origin, ..., dep_time)` ensures we only lag within each airport.\n- You may want to adjust axis limits or outlier filtering for clearer plots due to extreme delays.\n- For a more global plot (not split by origin), remove `group_by(origin)`.\n- Using a smooth line (`geom_smooth()`) can help clarify the overall trend.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see the code focused on a single origin, or with additional grouping/plotting adjustments!\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: This is a classic example of temporal autocorrelation in flight delays! We’ll use `dplyr` to compute the lagged delays within each **origin** (since delays are correlated locally in time at each airport), and then plot mean `dep_delay` vs lagged `dep_delay` using `ggplot2`.\n\nBelow is tidyverse/dplyr code to do this (assuming you have the `flights` tibble loaded, as in the `nycflights13` dataset):\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_by_origin_time <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, dep_time) %>%                 # arrange by origin and departure time\n  group_by(origin) %>%                          # compute within each origin\n  mutate(lag_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%    # get the dep_delay of the previous flight at that origin\n  ungroup()\n\n# Now calculate the mean dep_delay for each value of lag_dep_delay (binning for clarity)\nbinned <- flights_by_origin_time %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(lag_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(lag_bin = cut(lag_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 500, by = 10))) %>%     # bin lagged delays\n  group_by(lag_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            lag_center = (as.numeric(sub(\"\\\\((.+),.+\\\\]\", \"\\\\1\", lag_bin)) + \n                          as.numeric(sub(\".+,(.+)\\\\]\", \"\\\\1\", lag_bin)))/2) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(lag_center))\n\nggplot(binned, aes(x=lag_center, y=mean_dep_delay)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  labs(x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n       y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n       title = \"Mean Flight Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We arrange by `origin` and time, as delays are locally contagious.\n- Use `mutate(lag_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` to get each flight’s \"previous\" flight’s delay.\n- To make the plot clearer, we bin `lag_dep_delay` (using `cut()`) into intervals.\n- Compute the *mean* `dep_delay` for each bin of lagged delay.\n- Plot the relationship. The plot should show a positive association, indicating temporal correlation: if the last flight was delayed, you're likelier to be delayed!\n\n**Without binning**: (for a scatterplot, which will be very noisy)\n\n```r\nflights_by_origin_time %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(lag_dep_delay)) %>%\n  sample_frac(0.05) %>%   # to avoid overplotting; use a small percent if you like\n  ggplot(aes(x = lag_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.1) +\n  labs(x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (min)\",\n       y = \"Departure Delay (min)\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Departure Delay vs Lagged Departure Delay\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis answers the task: **Visualize the mean departure delay *vs* the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight.**\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The mean departure delay should be calculated by grouping on the numeric lagged departure delay\n3.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Since delays are highly correlated within the same airport, **let’s do this “per origin”** (so the previous flight is from the same airport).\n\nHere's how you can do it using **tidyverse**. This code:\n\n1. Groups by `origin` and arranges by time.\n2. Uses `lag()` to get the previous flight's `dep_delay`.\n3. Bins/rounds the previous delay for easier plotting (optional).\n4. Visualizes the relationship.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(time_hour, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Optionally: bin delays for smoother plots\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_binned = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-20, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_binned) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            prev_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n- Groups flights by `origin`.\n- Sorts them by time.\n- For each, finds the `dep_delay` of the previous flight.\n- Groups by binned previous delay, and plots the average.\n\nYou should see a clear positive relationship: when the previous flight was delayed, the mean departure delay of the next is higher.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a scatterplot of all (without binning):\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(time_hour, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Departure Delay vs Previous Flight\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nFor large datasets, binning or using `geom_hex()` or `geom_density2d()` is helpful for visualization.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to focus on a particular airport or facet by `carrier`!"

Since delays are highly correlated within the same airport, **let’s do this “per origin”** (so the previous flight is from the same airport).\n\nHere's how you can do it using **tidyverse**. This code:\n\n1. Groups by `origin` and arranges by time.\n2. Uses `lag()` to get the previous flight's `dep_delay`.\n3. Bins/rounds the previous delay for easier plotting (optional).\n4. Visualizes the relationship.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(time_hour, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Optionally: bin delays for smoother plots\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_binned = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-20, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_binned) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            prev_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n- Groups flights by `origin`.\n- Sorts them by time.\n- For each, finds the `dep_delay` of the previous flight.\n- Groups by binned previous delay, and plots the average.\n\nYou should see a clear positive relationship: when the previous flight was delayed, the mean departure delay of the next is higher.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a scatterplot of all (without binning):\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(time_hour, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Departure Delay vs Previous Flight\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nFor large datasets, binning or using `geom_hex()` or `geom_density2d()` is helpful for visualization.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to focus on a particular airport or facet by `carrier`!",

The Root Problem\n\n**405 Method Not Allowed** means **the server does not accept the combination of method (GET) and what you are sending (body)**.\n\n**In HTTP,** the `GET` method is *not supposed to have a request body* (even though technically some servers accept it, most do not).\n\nYou are sending:\n\n- HTTP method: `GET`\n- With a JSON body (`-d` in cURL and `req_body_json()` in R)\n\n**This is NOT allowed by most servers**. That's why you get a 405 error.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Solution: Switch to `POST`\n\nUsually, when you need to send a JSON body with parameters, the endpoint expects a **POST** method.\n\n**Confirm in the API docs** if this is the case.\n\n**Your cURL should look like:**\n```sh\ncurl -X POST 'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n      \"id\": 5,\n      \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n      \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\n**Your httr2 R code should be:**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type`= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\" )\n  ) %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\")   # <-- Add this!\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. If Only GET Is Allowed\n\nIf the API **only** supports GET, you must put your parameters in the **query string**, NOT in the body.\n\n**Example:**\n\ncURL:\n```sh\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nhttr2:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal  = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- **405 error** is because you used `GET` with a body (not standard).\n- **Solution:** Use `POST` if you need to send body JSON.\n    - Use `req_method(\"POST\")` in httr2, and `-X POST` in cURL.\n- If the API only talks `GET`, pass your data as **URL query parameters** and do not use a body.\n\n---\n\n### **If you show the API documentation or endpoint details, I can provide the exact code!**\n\n---\n\n**Let me know which method your endpoint expects (GET with query or POST with JSON body) and I'll give you the precise syntax.**"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies that there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code.\n\nLooking at the submission, the answer does address the HTTP 405 error by noting that the problem is trying to use a GET request with a request body, which is not allowed by HTTP standards. The submission offers two solutions:\n\n1. Use POST instead of GET when sending a body (which is the recommended solution)\n2. Use GET with query parameters instead of a body\n\nFor the Option 1 solution in R/httr2, the submission explicitly includes `req_method(\"POST\")` in the code:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  ...\n```\n\nFor the Option 2 solution, the submission also explicitly includes `req_method(\"GET\")`:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  ...\n```\n\nThe criterion is asking whether the submission identifies that there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code. While the submission doesn't explicitly state \"there's a missing `req_method()` call in your code\", it does correctly identify that the method specification is the key issue and provides solutions that explicitly include the `req_method()` function in both options.\n\nThe submission effectively addresses the missing method specification by including it in the corrected code examples, even though it doesn't literally state \"you're missing req_method(\"GET\")\".\n\nGRADE: C",

In your `curl` example, you are using:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' ...\n  -d '{ ... }'\n```\n**But!**  \nPer the HTTP standard, **GET requests should not send a request body** (`-d '...'`), and most servers will reject a GET with a body.\n\n### What does this mean?\n\n- `-X 'GET'` with `-d` in curl → sending a JSON body with GET → most servers will return 405 or 400.\n- Similarly, in `httr2`, you are building a request and attaching a JSON body, but by default, this will be a POST unless you specify otherwise—or in this case, you're mimicking a GET with body.\n\n### How to fix\n\n#### Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): **Use POST for requests with a body**\n\nDouble-check the **API documentation**. If you need to send data in the body (like your JSON), the endpoint probably expects a **POST**, not a **GET**.\n\n##### Curl:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n##### R/httr2:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type`= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n#### Option 2: **If the API Requires GET (Unlikely)**\nIf **the API expects a GET**, **do not send a request body**. Send the parameters as **query parameters**:\n\n##### Curl:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET 'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\n##### R/httr2:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n----\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Body data? | Use method | How to send data         | Example                |\n|:-----------|:-----------|:------------------------|:-----------------------|\n| Yes        | POST       | JSON body               | `-d '{...}'`           |\n| No         | GET        | As query parameters     | `?id=4&fecha...`       |\n\n\n**Check your API's requirements** and pick the matching approach.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- **GET** + **body** → ERROR 405 on most APIs\n- **POST** + **body** → Usually works if API supports it (likely in your case)\n- **GET** + query parameters → works if API expects them in URL\n\nIf you still have issues, provide the **API documentation or endpoint reference** and I can help further!",

          "explanation": "I'm evaluating whether the submission addresses the specific criterion of a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code.\n\nLooking at the submission, the answerer correctly identified that there's an issue with trying to send a body with a GET request, which is causing the 405 Method Not Allowed error. The submission provides two solutions:\n\n1. Change to a POST request by adding `req_method(\"POST\")` to the httr2 code\n2. Keep using GET but move parameters to the query string using `req_url_query()`\n\nHowever, the criterion specifically states that there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code. While the submission mentions `req_method(\"POST\")` as part of the solution, it doesn't explicitly point out that the original code is missing the `req_method(\"GET\")` statement. \n\nThe original R code appears to implicitly use GET (as the default method) but doesn't explicitly set it with `req_method(\"GET\")`. The submission focuses on the incompatibility of GET with a request body rather than identifying the missing method statement.\n\nSince the submission doesn't explicitly identify the missing `req_method(\"GET\")` as specified in the criterion, I must conclude that it doesn't meet this specific criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

The submission provides two solutions:\n\n1. Change to a POST request by adding `req_method(\"POST\")` to the httr2 code\n2. Keep using GET but move parameters to the query string using `req_url_query()`\n\nHowever, the criterion specifically states that there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code. While the submission mentions `req_method(\"POST\")` as part of the solution, it doesn't explicitly point out that the original code is missing the `req_method(\"GET\")` statement. \n\nThe original R code appears to implicitly use GET (as the default method) but doesn't explicitly set it with `req_method(\"GET\")`. The submission focuses on the incompatibility of GET with a request body rather than identifying the missing method statement.\n\nSince the submission doesn't explicitly identify the missing `req_method(\"GET\")` as specified in the criterion, I must conclude that it doesn't meet this specific criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

              "text": "Great question! You’re correct that `ggplot2` will include the unused factor levels in the legend when you use `drop = FALSE` in your scale, but by default, the legend key for unused levels will be blank.\n\n**Why does this happen?**  \nBecause there is no corresponding data for \"d\" in your data frame, `ggplot2` leaves the key (symbol, like point or line) for \"d\" blank in the legend.\n\n## Solution: Add \"dummy\" data for unused levels\n\n### Method 1: Manually Add a Dummy Row\n\nYou can add a dummy row to your dataframe for each unused level, and use `alpha = 0` (fully transparent), `size = 0` or set the point outside the plotting area. That way, ggplot will generate a symbol for \"d\", but it won’t appear on your plot.\n\n```r\n# Add a dummy row with z = \"d\"\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired legend, showing a green point next to \"d\".\n\n**You can further hide the dummy point:**\n\n- If you don't want to have any missing/NA in the x/y, you can set x/y outside the plotting range and set `show.legend = TRUE`.\n- Or set its `alpha = 0` (fully transparent), though the legend key will still be fully visible.\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Use `override.aes` with `guide_legend()`\n\nIf you wish to customize the legend keys directly, you can use the `override.aes` argument within `guide_legend()`, which controls what is drawn for each legend entry.\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\n\nHowever, this will **not** fix the symbol for \"d\" if it’s not present in the data. Only entries present in the data will have a point shown.\n\n---\n\n#### So: **Adding the dummy row is the only reliable way to display a colored dot for unused factor levels in the ggplot2 legend!**\n\n---\n\n## Final, Minimal Example\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add unused level as a dummy\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Result:** The legend will show a colored dot for all four levels, including \"d\".\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAdd a dummy observation for unused factor levels (with e.g., `x=NA`, `y=NA`) to make ggplot2 draw a colored symbol for them in the legend.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [ggplot2 issue discussion #2809](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2809)  \n- [Stack Overflow: Unused factor legend ggplot2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40398093/ggplot2-legend-for-all-factor-levels-including-unused)"

That way, ggplot will generate a symbol for \"d\", but it won’t appear on your plot.\n\n```r\n# Add a dummy row with z = \"d\"\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired legend, showing a green point next to \"d\".\n\n**You can further hide the dummy point:**\n\n- If you don't want to have any missing/NA in the x/y, you can set x/y outside the plotting range and set `show.legend = TRUE`.\n- Or set its `alpha = 0` (fully transparent), though the legend key will still be fully visible.\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Use `override.aes` with `guide_legend()`\n\nIf you wish to customize the legend keys directly, you can use the `override.aes` argument within `guide_legend()`, which controls what is drawn for each legend entry.\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\n\nHowever, this will **not** fix the symbol for \"d\" if it’s not present in the data.

                      "text": "Great question! You’re correct that `ggplot2` will include the unused factor levels in the legend when you use `drop = FALSE` in your scale, but by default, the legend key for unused levels will be blank.\n\n**Why does this happen?**  \nBecause there is no corresponding data for \"d\" in your data frame, `ggplot2` leaves the key (symbol, like point or line) for \"d\" blank in the legend.\n\n## Solution: Add \"dummy\" data for unused levels\n\n### Method 1: Manually Add a Dummy Row\n\nYou can add a dummy row to your dataframe for each unused level, and use `alpha = 0` (fully transparent), `size = 0` or set the point outside the plotting area. That way, ggplot will generate a symbol for \"d\", but it won’t appear on your plot.\n\n```r\n# Add a dummy row with z = \"d\"\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired legend, showing a green point next to \"d\".\n\n**You can further hide the dummy point:**\n\n- If you don't want to have any missing/NA in the x/y, you can set x/y outside the plotting range and set `show.legend = TRUE`.\n- Or set its `alpha = 0` (fully transparent), though the legend key will still be fully visible.\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Use `override.aes` with `guide_legend()`\n\nIf you wish to customize the legend keys directly, you can use the `override.aes` argument within `guide_legend()`, which controls what is drawn for each legend entry.\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\n\nHowever, this will **not** fix the symbol for \"d\" if it’s not present in the data. Only entries present in the data will have a point shown.\n\n---\n\n#### So: **Adding the dummy row is the only reliable way to display a colored dot for unused factor levels in the ggplot2 legend!**\n\n---\n\n## Final, Minimal Example\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add unused level as a dummy\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Result:** The legend will show a colored dot for all four levels, including \"d\".\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAdd a dummy observation for unused factor levels (with e.g., `x=NA`, `y=NA`) to make ggplot2 draw a colored symbol for them in the legend.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [ggplot2 issue discussion #2809](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2809)  \n- [Stack Overflow: Unused factor legend ggplot2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40398093/ggplot2-legend-for-all-factor-levels-including-unused)"

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: You're **almost** there! The behavior you describe is default ggplot2: when a factor level isn't used, it gets a blank spot in the legend (`d` in your example). This is intentional—basically, the legend shows the mapping but signals that `d` doesn't appear in your data.\n\n**If you want a colored dot for \"d,\"** even though `\"d\"` doesn't appear in your data, the only way is to *add an \"invisible\" point* belonging to `\"d\"`—e.g., by adding a fake data row—**or** by using a trick with the `override.aes` argument in `guide_legend()` (**ggplot2 3.0.0+**).\n\n## Option 1: Add a Dummy Point\n\nHere's a simple way:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n- The `NA` values mean the dummy point won't appear on the actual plot, but `\"d\"` will appear in the legend with a colored dot.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Use `override.aes` in Legend\n\nIf you'd rather not touch your data, you can use the `guide_legend()` function's `override.aes` to \"force\" points for all legend entries, even unused ones:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\n\n- By default this won't show a dot for unused levels (`d`), but setting `alpha = 1` ensures it's visible. If your points are not visible, you can also explicitly set `shape`, `size`, etc:\n\n```r\nguides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n```\n\nIf the dot still doesn't appear for \"d\", adding a dummy point (as above) is **the most reliable method**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n* **Dummy point approach**: most reliable, guarantees colored dot for unused levels.\n* `override.aes` can occasionally work but isn't always respected for levels not in data.\n\n**For \"d\" to have a green dot in the legend, add a dummy row in your data.**\n\n---\n\n## Complete Example\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNow legend will show a colored dot for `\"d\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Reference\n\nSee [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/3611) for more insight!\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This is intentional—basically, the legend shows the mapping but signals that `d` doesn't appear in your data.\n\n**If you want a colored dot for \"d,\"** even though `\"d\"` doesn't appear in your data, the only way is to *add an \"invisible\" point* belonging to `\"d\"`—e.g., by adding a fake data row—**or** by using a trick with the `override.aes` argument in `guide_legend()` (**ggplot2 3.0.0+**).\n\n## Option 1: Add a Dummy Point\n\nHere's a simple way:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n- The `NA` values mean the dummy point won't appear on the actual plot, but `\"d\"` will appear in the legend with a colored dot.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Use `override.aes` in Legend\n\nIf you'd rather not touch your data, you can use the `guide_legend()` function's `override.aes` to \"force\" points for all legend entries, even unused ones:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\n\n- By default this won't show a dot for unused levels (`d`), but setting `alpha = 1` ensures it's visible. If your points are not visible, you can also explicitly set `shape`, `size`, etc:\n\n```r\nguides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n```\n\nIf the dot still doesn't appear for \"d\", adding a dummy point (as above) is **the most reliable method**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n* **Dummy point approach**: most reliable, guarantees colored dot for unused levels.\n* `override.aes` can occasionally work but isn't always respected for levels not in data.\n\n**For \"d\" to have a green dot in the legend, add a dummy row in your data.**\n\n---\n\n## Complete Example\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNow legend will show a colored dot for `\"d\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Reference\n\nSee [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/3611) for more insight!",

The issue is caused by the fact that URLs cannot contain certain characters (like spaces and commas) without being **URL-encoded**. In your construction, the `{address}` variable is inserted **as-is** into the URL, so it contains spaces, commas, and a period:  \n```\nhttps://geocode.maps.co/search?q=Prince st., New York 10012&api_key=...\n```\nThis makes the URL **malformed**. You need to **URL-encode** the query parameters (especially `address`) before inserting them into the URL.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nInstead of interpolating the variables directly into the URL string, you should use **httr2**'s parameter helpers which take care of encoding for you.\n\n### Proper usage:\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nreq <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key)\n\nresp <- req %>% req_perform()\n```\n**Explanation:**\n- `req_url_query(q = address, ...)` adds the query parameters AND handles URL-encoding.\n\n**Alternatively**, if you need to manually encode (not recommended if using httr2's helpers), you could use `URLencode`:\n```r\naddress_enc <- URLencode(address)\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_enc}&api_key={api_key}\")\n```\nBut **using parameter helpers is preferred**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- **Problem:** Spaces and other characters in the query string are not encoded.\n- **Fix:** Use `req_url_query()` (httr2), or manually URL-encode the address.\n\n---\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nIf you want the parsed result:\n```r\nparsed <- resp %>% resp_body_json()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need help parsing the API response!**\n***\n[Criterion]: Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely, removing punctuation.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion of formatting the address to result in a valid URL by either replacing spaces and removing punctuation, or by using URL encoding functions.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core issue: the address string contains spaces and special characters that need to be properly encoded for a valid URL. It proposes two solutions:\n\n1. Using URL encoding functions:\n   - Suggests using `httr2::url_percent_encode(address)` to properly encode the address\n   - Also mentions `utils::URLencode()` as an alternative\n\n2. Using `httr2`'s query parameter functionality:\n   - Shows how to use `req_url_query()` which automatically handles percent-encoding\n\nBoth of these approaches directly address the criterion. The submission doesn't manually replace spaces with \"+\" as shown in the example criterion solution, but it correctly identifies that URL encoding is needed and demonstrates how to do it properly using R functions designed for this purpose.\n\nThe submission not only meets the criterion but goes beyond it by explaining the issue clearly and providing multiple correct ways to solve it, including the more robust approach of using `httr2`'s built-in parameter handling.\n\nGRADE: C",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

              "text": "**Goal**: When using `sec_axis()` or `dup_axis()` with discrete scales, if the **breaks argument is a named vector**, the names should be used as labels by default (unless explicit labels are provided).\n\nCurrently, this is **not** done: the breaks' names are not set as labels automatically.\n\nBelow are clear, minimal, minimal-invasiveness edits you should make:\n\n---\n\n### 1. In `AxisSecondary$init()`, add logic right after setting breaks, to check if the scale is discrete and breaks is a named vector, and use names as labels if labels are still derived/waiver/default.\n\nFind this block (near the bottom of `$init`):\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**Replace it with:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If discrete, and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**:  \n- This checks if `self$breaks` has names (and at least one is non-empty), and, if so, sets those as labels, unless the user already supplied explicit labels.\n\n---\n\n### 2. (Optionally) Add a test in `set_sec_axis` so that if breaks are named but labels are not provided, you pass the names, but the above logic is sufficient for most use.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Patch:**\n\nIn context, the `init` method changes from:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**To:**\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      # If discrete and breaks are named, use names as labels by default\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example for test\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), y = c(2, 4, 8))\n# Named breaks for discrete axis\nsec_axis_obj <- sec_axis(transform = identity, breaks = c(foo = \"a\", bar = \"b\"))\n# Should use c(\"foo\", \"bar\") as default labels on the secondary axis\n```\n\n---\n\n## Brief Explanation\n\n- When `breaks` is a named vector for a discrete axis, `names(breaks)` are often what the user intends to show as axis tick labels.\n- This edit preserves previous behavior when `breaks` are not named or for continuous axes, or if the user explicitly requests `labels`.\n\n---\n\n**No other part of the file need change for this feature.**"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer meets the criterion specified for handling named discrete breaks in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n1. In the `init` function where discrete breaks are set, use `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names\n2. In the `break_info` function where breaks are mapped, modify `scale$map(self$breaks)` to `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving names during the breaks handling, it adds logic to:\n- Check if the scale is discrete and breaks have names\n- If so, assign those names to the labels property\n\nThis is a valid approach conceptually, but it doesn't match the specific changes required by the criterion. The submission only adds a condition in the `init` method to set labels from break names, but doesn't modify the code to ensure names are preserved through the break handling process as specified in the criterion.\n\nThe submission would likely achieve a similar result in some cases, but doesn't implement the specific code changes requested, which focus on preserving names throughout the breaks handling process rather than just copying them to labels.\n\nGRADE: I",

In `AxisSecondary$init()`, add logic right after setting breaks, to check if the scale is discrete and breaks is a named vector, and use names as labels if labels are still derived/waiver/default.\n\nFind this block (near the bottom of `$init`):\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**Replace it with:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If discrete, and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**:  \n- This checks if `self$breaks` has names (and at least one is non-empty), and, if so, sets those as labels, unless the user already supplied explicit labels.\n\n---\n\n### 2. (Optionally) Add a test in `set_sec_axis` so that if breaks are named but labels are not provided, you pass the names, but the above logic is sufficient for most use.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Patch:**\n\nIn context, the `init` method changes from:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**To:**\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      # If discrete and breaks are named, use names as labels by default\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example for test\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), y = c(2, 4, 8))\n# Named breaks for discrete axis\nsec_axis_obj <- sec_axis(transform = identity, breaks = c(foo = \"a\", bar = \"b\"))\n# Should use c(\"foo\", \"bar\") as default labels on the secondary axis\n```\n\n---\n\n## Brief Explanation\n\n- When `breaks` is a named vector for a discrete axis, `names(breaks)` are often what the user intends to show as axis tick labels.\n- This edit preserves previous behavior when `breaks` are not named or for continuous axes, or if the user explicitly requests `labels`.\n\n---\n\n**No other part of the file need change for this feature.**\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In the `init` function where discrete breaks are set, use `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names\n2. In the `break_info` function where breaks are mapped, modify `scale$map(self$breaks)` to `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving names during the breaks handling, it adds logic to:\n- Check if the scale is discrete and breaks have names\n- If so, assign those names to the labels property\n\nThis is a valid approach conceptually, but it doesn't match the specific changes required by the criterion. The submission only adds a condition in the `init` method to set labels from break names, but doesn't modify the code to ensure names are preserved through the break handling process as specified in the criterion.\n\nThe submission would likely achieve a similar result in some cases, but doesn't implement the specific code changes requested, which focus on preserving names throughout the breaks handling process rather than just copying them to labels.\n\nGRADE: I"

In `AxisSecondary$init()`, add logic right after setting breaks, to check if the scale is discrete and breaks is a named vector, and use names as labels if labels are still derived/waiver/default.\n\nFind this block (near the bottom of `$init`):\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**Replace it with:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If discrete, and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**:  \n- This checks if `self$breaks` has names (and at least one is non-empty), and, if so, sets those as labels, unless the user already supplied explicit labels.\n\n---\n\n### 2. (Optionally) Add a test in `set_sec_axis` so that if breaks are named but labels are not provided, you pass the names, but the above logic is sufficient for most use.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Patch:**\n\nIn context, the `init` method changes from:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**To:**\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      # If discrete and breaks are named, use names as labels by default\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example for test\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), y = c(2, 4, 8))\n# Named breaks for discrete axis\nsec_axis_obj <- sec_axis(transform = identity, breaks = c(foo = \"a\", bar = \"b\"))\n# Should use c(\"foo\", \"bar\") as default labels on the secondary axis\n```\n\n---\n\n## Brief Explanation\n\n- When `breaks` is a named vector for a discrete axis, `names(breaks)` are often what the user intends to show as axis tick labels.\n- This edit preserves previous behavior when `breaks` are not named or for continuous axes, or if the user explicitly requests `labels`.\n\n---\n\n**No other part of the file need change for this feature.**"

In `AxisSecondary$init()`, add logic right after setting breaks, to check if the scale is discrete and breaks is a named vector, and use names as labels if labels are still derived/waiver/default.\n\nFind this block (near the bottom of `$init`):\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**Replace it with:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If discrete, and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary**:  \n- This checks if `self$breaks` has names (and at least one is non-empty), and, if so, sets those as labels, unless the user already supplied explicit labels.\n\n---\n\n### 2. (Optionally) Add a test in `set_sec_axis` so that if breaks are named but labels are not provided, you pass the names, but the above logic is sufficient for most use.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Patch:**\n\nIn context, the `init` method changes from:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**To:**\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      # If discrete and breaks are named, use names as labels by default\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example for test\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), y = c(2, 4, 8))\n# Named breaks for discrete axis\nsec_axis_obj <- sec_axis(transform = identity, breaks = c(foo = \"a\", bar = \"b\"))\n# Should use c(\"foo\", \"bar\") as default labels on the secondary axis\n```\n\n---\n\n## Brief Explanation\n\n- When `breaks` is a named vector for a discrete axis, `names(breaks)` are often what the user intends to show as axis tick labels.\n- This edit preserves previous behavior when `breaks` are not named or for continuous axes, or if the user explicitly requests `labels`.\n\n---\n\n**No other part of the file need change for this feature.**",

You're right—currently, if you supply named breaks to a discrete `scale_*` with `sec_axis()`, the names are ignored and the values are used both as breaks and labels. This isn't consistent with ggplot2's default behavior for _primary_ discrete scales, where **names of named breaks are used as labels by default**.\n\n## What to change\n\nLook for where, in the secondary axis machinery, breaks and labels are initialized for discrete scales. \n\nIn the **`AxisSecondary$init()` method**, when the secondary scale is discrete and `breaks` isn't derived or overridden, the code assigns `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()`. If labels are not specified, it simply copies `self$labels <- scale$labels`. You want instead:\n\n- **If `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is still at its default, use `names(breaks)` as labels.**\n  \nMore formally, **if `self$labels` is still a `waiver()` and `self$breaks` is a character or factor vector with non-empty names, then use names as labels**.\n\n## Code changes\n\nAdd a block like the following **after** setting `self$breaks` in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nLet's show the relevant part (shortened for clarity):\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      # ... continuous logic ...\n    }\n  }\n  # >>> Insert this new block:\n  if (\n    is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n    scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n  ) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n  # <<< end new block\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Full diff patch\n\nHere's the minimal patch you need:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n         n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n         if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n           self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n         } else {\n           self$breaks <- breaks\n         }\n       }\n     }\n+    # Use names as labels for discrete secondary axes if not otherwise specified\n+    if (\n+      is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n+      scale$is_discrete() &&\n+      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n+      any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n+    ) {\n+      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+    }\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\n## After this change\n\nA plot like:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(Apples=1, Oranges=2)))\n```\n\nwill show \"Apples\" and \"Oranges\" as the secondary axis labels.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Add this block after initializing `self$breaks` in the `AxisSecondary$init` method:**\n\n```r\nif (\n  is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n  scale$is_discrete() &&\n  !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n  any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default on secondary axes, just like on primary axes.",
          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submission meets the criterion by comparing the proposed changes in the submission against the criterion's specification.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific code changes:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the `if (scale$is_discrete())` block.\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `else` block.\n\nThe submission doesn't make either of these specific changes. Instead, it proposes adding a new code block that checks if labels are a waiver, the scale is discrete, and if breaks have names, then uses those names as labels.\n\nThe approach in the submission is different from what the criterion specifies. The criterion is focused on preserving the names during the breaks assignment process, while the submission focuses on using the existing names of breaks to set labels.\n\nWhile the submission might achieve a similar outcome in some cases, it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically asks for changes to ensure names are preserved when getting breaks from the scale or mapping breaks, not for a conditional block to use existing names as labels.\n\nGRADE: I",

You want instead:\n\n- **If `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is still at its default, use `names(breaks)` as labels.**\n  \nMore formally, **if `self$labels` is still a `waiver()` and `self$breaks` is a character or factor vector with non-empty names, then use names as labels**.\n\n## Code changes\n\nAdd a block like the following **after** setting `self$breaks` in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nLet's show the relevant part (shortened for clarity):\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      # ... continuous logic ...\n    }\n  }\n  # >>> Insert this new block:\n  if (\n    is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n    scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n  ) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n  # <<< end new block\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Full diff patch\n\nHere's the minimal patch you need:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n         n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n         if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n           self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n         } else {\n           self$breaks <- breaks\n         }\n       }\n     }\n+    # Use names as labels for discrete secondary axes if not otherwise specified\n+    if (\n+      is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n+      scale$is_discrete() &&\n+      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n+      any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n+    ) {\n+      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+    }\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\n## After this change\n\nA plot like:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(Apples=1, Oranges=2)))\n```\n\nwill show \"Apples\" and \"Oranges\" as the secondary axis labels.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Add this block after initializing `self$breaks` in the `AxisSecondary$init` method:**\n\n```r\nif (\n  is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n  scale$is_discrete() &&\n  !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n  any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default on secondary axes, just like on primary axes.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `else` block.\n\nThe submission doesn't make either of these specific changes. Instead, it proposes adding a new code block that checks if labels are a waiver, the scale is discrete, and if breaks have names, then uses those names as labels.\n\nThe approach in the submission is different from what the criterion specifies. The criterion is focused on preserving the names during the breaks assignment process, while the submission focuses on using the existing names of breaks to set labels.\n\nWhile the submission might achieve a similar outcome in some cases, it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically asks for changes to ensure names are preserved when getting breaks from the scale or mapping breaks, not for a conditional block to use existing names as labels.\n\nGRADE: I"

                      "text": "Great request! You're right—currently, if you supply named breaks to a discrete `scale_*` with `sec_axis()`, the names are ignored and the values are used both as breaks and labels. This isn't consistent with ggplot2's default behavior for _primary_ discrete scales, where **names of named breaks are used as labels by default**.\n\n## What to change\n\nLook for where, in the secondary axis machinery, breaks and labels are initialized for discrete scales. \n\nIn the **`AxisSecondary$init()` method**, when the secondary scale is discrete and `breaks` isn't derived or overridden, the code assigns `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()`. If labels are not specified, it simply copies `self$labels <- scale$labels`. You want instead:\n\n- **If `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is still at its default, use `names(breaks)` as labels.**\n  \nMore formally, **if `self$labels` is still a `waiver()` and `self$breaks` is a character or factor vector with non-empty names, then use names as labels**.\n\n## Code changes\n\nAdd a block like the following **after** setting `self$breaks` in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nLet's show the relevant part (shortened for clarity):\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      # ... continuous logic ...\n    }\n  }\n  # >>> Insert this new block:\n  if (\n    is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n    scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n  ) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n  # <<< end new block\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Full diff patch\n\nHere's the minimal patch you need:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n         n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n         if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n           self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n         } else {\n           self$breaks <- breaks\n         }\n       }\n     }\n+    # Use names as labels for discrete secondary axes if not otherwise specified\n+    if (\n+      is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n+      scale$is_discrete() &&\n+      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n+      any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n+    ) {\n+      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+    }\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\n## After this change\n\nA plot like:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(Apples=1, Oranges=2)))\n```\n\nwill show \"Apples\" and \"Oranges\" as the secondary axis labels.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Add this block after initializing `self$breaks` in the `AxisSecondary$init` method:**\n\n```r\nif (\n  is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n  scale$is_discrete() &&\n  !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n  any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default on secondary axes, just like on primary axes."

                  "text": "Great request! You're right—currently, if you supply named breaks to a discrete `scale_*` with `sec_axis()`, the names are ignored and the values are used both as breaks and labels. This isn't consistent with ggplot2's default behavior for _primary_ discrete scales, where **names of named breaks are used as labels by default**.\n\n## What to change\n\nLook for where, in the secondary axis machinery, breaks and labels are initialized for discrete scales. \n\nIn the **`AxisSecondary$init()` method**, when the secondary scale is discrete and `breaks` isn't derived or overridden, the code assigns `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()`. If labels are not specified, it simply copies `self$labels <- scale$labels`. You want instead:\n\n- **If `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is still at its default, use `names(breaks)` as labels.**\n  \nMore formally, **if `self$labels` is still a `waiver()` and `self$breaks` is a character or factor vector with non-empty names, then use names as labels**.\n\n## Code changes\n\nAdd a block like the following **after** setting `self$breaks` in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nLet's show the relevant part (shortened for clarity):\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      # ... continuous logic ...\n    }\n  }\n  # >>> Insert this new block:\n  if (\n    is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n    scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n  ) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n  # <<< end new block\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Full diff patch\n\nHere's the minimal patch you need:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n         n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n         if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n           self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n         } else {\n           self$breaks <- breaks\n         }\n       }\n     }\n+    # Use names as labels for discrete secondary axes if not otherwise specified\n+    if (\n+      is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n+      scale$is_discrete() &&\n+      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n+      any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n+    ) {\n+      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+    }\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\n## After this change\n\nA plot like:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(Apples=1, Oranges=2)))\n```\n\nwill show \"Apples\" and \"Oranges\" as the secondary axis labels.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Add this block after initializing `self$breaks` in the `AxisSecondary$init` method:**\n\n```r\nif (\n  is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n  scale$is_discrete() &&\n  !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n  any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))\n) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default on secondary axes, just like on primary axes.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the specific criterion for editing the code to allow discrete breaks with names to be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the discrete-scale branch\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the discrete breaks section\n\nLooking at the submission, it takes a different approach:\n- Instead of modifying how breaks are set, it adds new code that explicitly checks for named breaks and sets labels accordingly.\n- The submitted approach adds this logic: \n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission's approach might achieve a similar outcome functionally (using break names as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically calls for modifying how breaks are set by preserving names through `setNames()` in two specific places, whereas the submission adds conditional logic to manually set labels based on break names.\n\nThe submission is taking a different approach than what was specifically asked for in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the discrete breaks section\n\nLooking at the submission, it takes a different approach:\n- Instead of modifying how breaks are set, it adds new code that explicitly checks for named breaks and sets labels accordingly.\n- The submitted approach adds this logic: \n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission's approach might achieve a similar outcome functionally (using break names as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically calls for modifying how breaks are set by preserving names through `setNames()` in two specific places, whereas the submission adds conditional logic to manually set labels based on break names.\n\nThe submission is taking a different approach than what was specifically asked for in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

When you want breaks with names (e.g., `c(\"A\"=1, \"B\"=2)`), often you want those names as labels.\n\n**Currently:**  \nThe above code for secondary axes sets `labels = waiver()` by default. But when discrete breaks are *named* and you don't supply `labels`, you want `labels = names(breaks)`.\n\n## Where to make the change\n\nThe logic for setting default labels is in `AxisSecondary$init()`. Currently:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut if `self$labels` is still a waiver and the scale is discrete, and `self$breaks` is a named vector, you'd want to set `self$labels` to `names(self$breaks)`.\n\nYou can improve this by adding, **after** the above line:\n\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\n### Full edited section (`init =` function):\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n  # NEW: Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete/named case\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() &&\n      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n## Optional: Add to doc\n\nYou may want to update the docs in `@param labels` and `@details` to mention if breaks are named, labels default to those names for discrete axes.\n\n---\n\n## Final patch:\n\nReplace **just** this section in your code above:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n  # <<<<<<<<<<< NEW LOGIC HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() &&\n      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  }\n  # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\nThis change makes **secondary discrete axes use the names of breaks as default labels, when names are provided**, matching expected R/ggplot2 behaviour in other contexts."

Let's compare:\n\nWhat the criterion expects:\n1. Filter first to only keep tailnums with more than 100 flights using `.by = tailnum` or `group_by()`\n2. Summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange in descending order of the NA proportion\n\nWhat the submission does:\n1. Groups by tailnum\n2. Summarizes to count total flights, count NA delays, and calculate proportion\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranges in descending order of NA proportion\n\nThe key issue is that the submission calculates the count first, then filters, which reverses the order of operations from what's expected in the criterion. This approach is mathematically equivalent but logically different.\n\nThe submission also uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` instead of `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`. These are mathematically equivalent, but the criterion specifically mentions using `mean()`.\n\nWhile the submission will produce the correct answer, it doesn't follow the expected approach of filtering before summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P",

To find the `tailnum` with the **highest proportion** of NA `arr_delay`s, but **only including those that have flown at least 100 flights**, you can use the following tidyverse (dplyr) code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `group_by(tailnum)`: group all flights by `tailnum`\n- `summarise(...)`: count total flights, number with NA `arr_delay`, and calculate the proportion\n- `filter(total_flights >= 100)`: only include tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))`: sort descending by proportion of NA `arr_delay`\n- `slice(1)`: get the tailnum with the highest such proportion\n\n**This returns the row(s) with the `tailnum` you seek, along with its stats.**\n\nIf you want *just the tailnum*, you can add `%>% pull(tailnum)` at the end.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Let's compare:\n\nWhat the criterion expects:\n1. Filter first to only keep tailnums with more than 100 flights using `.by = tailnum` or `group_by()`\n2. Summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange in descending order of the NA proportion\n\nWhat the submission does:\n1. Groups by tailnum\n2. Summarizes to count total flights, count NA delays, and calculate proportion\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranges in descending order of NA proportion\n\nThe key issue is that the submission calculates the count first, then filters, which reverses the order of operations from what's expected in the criterion. This approach is mathematically equivalent but logically different.\n\nThe submission also uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` instead of `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`. These are mathematically equivalent, but the criterion specifically mentions using `mean()`.\n\nWhile the submission will produce the correct answer, it doesn't follow the expected approach of filtering before summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P"

To find the `tailnum` with the **highest proportion** of NA `arr_delay`s, but **only including those that have flown at least 100 flights**, you can use the following tidyverse (dplyr) code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `group_by(tailnum)`: group all flights by `tailnum`\n- `summarise(...)`: count total flights, number with NA `arr_delay`, and calculate the proportion\n- `filter(total_flights >= 100)`: only include tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))`: sort descending by proportion of NA `arr_delay`\n- `slice(1)`: get the tailnum with the highest such proportion\n\n**This returns the row(s) with the `tailnum` you seek, along with its stats.**\n\nIf you want *just the tailnum*, you can add `%>% pull(tailnum)` at the end."

          "explanation": "I'll assess the submitted answer against the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the main task: finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delay values among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nLooking at the approach:\n\n1. The submission groups by tailnum\n2. It calculates the number of flights per tailnum using n()\n3. It calculates the proportion of NA arr_delay values using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n4. It filters to include only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n5. It arranges in descending order of the NA proportion\n6. It extracts the top result\n\nHowever, there's an important difference from the required approach in the criterion. The criterion specifies that the first step should be a grouped filter that keeps only rows from tailnums that have > 100 flights, without persistent summarization. The submission instead first counts all flights per tailnum and then filters those counts.\n\nThe correct approach according to the criterion would be to:\n1. Group by tailnum and filter to keep only groups with > 100 flights\n2. Then summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values\n3. Then arrange in descending order\n\nWhile the submission will yield the correct result, it doesn't follow the specified approach in the criterion. It uses filter(n_flights >= 100) on the summarized data rather than filter(n() > 100) on the grouped original data.\n\nGRADE: P",

The key steps:\n\n1. Group flights by `tailnum`.\n2. Count the number of flights per tailnum.\n3. For each tailnum, compute the proportion of flights where `arr_delay` is NA.\n4. Filter to tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n5. Arrange by descending proportion of NA.\n6. Pull the top result.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis will return the `tailnum` (aircraft registration) with the highest proportion of missing arrival delay times, among those that have at least 100 flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission groups by tailnum\n2. It calculates the number of flights per tailnum using n()\n3. It calculates the proportion of NA arr_delay values using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n4. It filters to include only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n5. It arranges in descending order of the NA proportion\n6. It extracts the top result\n\nHowever, there's an important difference from the required approach in the criterion. The criterion specifies that the first step should be a grouped filter that keeps only rows from tailnums that have > 100 flights, without persistent summarization. The submission instead first counts all flights per tailnum and then filters those counts.\n\nThe correct approach according to the criterion would be to:\n1. Group by tailnum and filter to keep only groups with > 100 flights\n2. Then summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values\n3. Then arrange in descending order\n\nWhile the submission will yield the correct result, it doesn't follow the specified approach in the criterion. It uses filter(n_flights >= 100) on the summarized data rather than filter(n() > 100) on the grouped original data.\n\nGRADE: P"

The key steps:\n\n1. Group flights by `tailnum`.\n2. Count the number of flights per tailnum.\n3. For each tailnum, compute the proportion of flights where `arr_delay` is NA.\n4. Filter to tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n5. Arrange by descending proportion of NA.\n6. Pull the top result.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis will return the `tailnum` (aircraft registration) with the highest proportion of missing arrival delay times, among those that have at least 100 flights."

Filter to tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n5. Arrange by descending proportion of NA.\n6.

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criteria for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe submission's approach has three main parts:\n1. Group by `tailnum` and calculate summary statistics\n2. Filter for planes with at least 100 flights\n3. Arrange in descending order of NA proportion and select the top result\n\nLet's compare with the criterion:\n\n**Issue 1**: The submission filters after summarizing, which is incorrect. The criterion specifically states that filtering should happen first, before summarization. The submission does:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(...) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100)\n```\nWhen it should do:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>% \n  summarize(...)\n```\n\n**Issue 2**: The calculation for proportion of NAs is correct (using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n()` or similar), though it could be simplified by using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as shown in the criterion.\n\n**Issue 3**: The submission correctly arranges in descending order to find the highest proportion.\n\nSince the submission gets the overall approach right but makes a critical error in the order of operations (filtering after summarizing instead of before), which could lead to different results, this is a partially correct answer.\n\nGRADE: P",

For each plane, **count the number of flights** and **the number of NA `arr_delay`** values.\n3. **Filter** to planes that have **at least 100 flights**.\n4. **Compute the proportion** of flights with NA `arr_delay`.\n5. **Arrange** by descending order of this proportion and **select** the tailnum with the highest proportion.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    n_na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = n_na_arr_delay / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na_arr_delay, n_flights)\n```\n\nThis will give you the tailnum, its proportion of NA `arr_delay`s, and the number of flights for that plane.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Arrange in descending order of NA proportion and select the top result\n\nLet's compare with the criterion:\n\n**Issue 1**: The submission filters after summarizing, which is incorrect. The criterion specifically states that filtering should happen first, before summarization. The submission does:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(...) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100)\n```\nWhen it should do:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>% \n  summarize(...)\n```\n\n**Issue 2**: The calculation for proportion of NAs is correct (using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n()` or similar), though it could be simplified by using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as shown in the criterion.\n\n**Issue 3**: The submission correctly arranges in descending order to find the highest proportion.\n\nSince the submission gets the overall approach right but makes a critical error in the order of operations (filtering after summarizing instead of before), which could lead to different results, this is a partially correct answer.\n\nGRADE: P"

For each plane, **count the number of flights** and **the number of NA `arr_delay`** values.\n3. **Filter** to planes that have **at least 100 flights**.\n4. **Compute the proportion** of flights with NA `arr_delay`.\n5. **Arrange** by descending order of this proportion and **select** the tailnum with the highest proportion.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    n_na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = n_na_arr_delay / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na_arr_delay, n_flights)\n```\n\nThis will give you the tailnum, its proportion of NA `arr_delay`s, and the number of flights for that plane."

Instead, you use `group_by()` before `mutate()`.\n- In **data.table**, `by` is used, but its syntax is different: `DT[, .(newvar = foo), by = .(id, date)]`.\n\n### Most Likely Problem\n\nYou (or your code) wrote something like:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ..., by = c(id, date))\n```\nor\n```r\ndf %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ..., .by = c(id, date))\n```\n\nBut **this is not how grouping works in `mutate()`**. dplyr expects you to do:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ...)\n```\n\nNo `by` or `.by` parameter in `mutate()`!\n\n### How to Fix\n\n**Use `group_by()` BEFORE `mutate()`:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ...) # whatever calculation you want\n```\n\n**Or, with data.table:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(data.table)\nDT[, new_var := ..., by = .(id, date)]\n```\n\n---\n## Summary Table\n\n| Package     | Grouping Syntax                | Correct Use                 |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| dplyr       | `group_by(id, date)` before `mutate()` | `mutate()` w/o `by`/`.by` |\n| data.table  | `by = .(id, date)` within `[...]`    | `DT[, newvar := ..., by = .(id, date)]` |\n\n---\n\n### **TL;DR**  \n- **Do not use `by =` or `.by =` in `mutate()`!**\n- Instead, use `group_by()` before `mutate()` in dplyr.\n\n### **Example of Correct dplyr Use**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(new_var = sum(some_column))\n```\n\nIf you need more help, paste a small sample of your code or data!",

Let's clarify and fix the issue.\n\n## 1. **Understanding the Error**\n\n- `.by` or `by` is _not_ a valid argument for `dplyr::mutate()` (as of dplyr v1.1.0 and later, the argument is `.by` **not** `by`).\n- **Group-wise calculations** are done in `mutate()` by either:\n  - Using `group_by()` before `mutate()`\n  - Or (with recent dplyr), supplying a `.by` argument to some dplyr verbs, but _not all_ of them support it yet.\n\n- The error arises because `mutate()` doesn't know what to do with your `by` argument.\n\n## 2. **How to Fix**\n\n### **A. Use `group_by()` Instead**\nThe most robust and widely used way is:\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ...) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\n### **B. Using `.by` (in dplyr >= 1.1.0, for some verbs)**\nAs of dplyr 1.1.0, several verbs support `.by`, **but `mutate()` did not support `.by` as of 2024-06 (check your dplyr version and docs to be sure!).**\n- For now, safest is to use `group_by()`.\n- If using functions like `summarise(.by = ...)`, that works. But not for `mutate()` (yet).\n\n### **C. Remove the `by` Argument From `mutate()`**\nJust remove `by = c(id, date)` from your mutate call.\n\n> **Your broken code (as per the error)**\n> ```r\n> df %>% mutate(..., by = c(id, date))\n> ```\n>\n> **Should be**\n> ```r\n> df %>%\n>   group_by(id, date) %>%\n>   mutate(...)\n> ```\n> And then, if necessary, `ungroup()`.\n\n## 3. **References**\n\n- `mutate()` documentation: <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html>\n- dplyr 1.1.0 release notes: <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/03/dplyr-1-1-0/>\n\n## 4. **Summary**\n\n- **Remove the `by` argument from `mutate()`.**\n- Use `group_by()` for group-wise calculations in `mutate()`.\n\n---\n\n**If you show your exact code, I can give a more specific fix!**",

To accomplish this, you generally want a way to capture the **expression** passed to the `dataset` argument, as a string, unless the user provides an explicit `name=` argument.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Add an argument `name` defaulting to **the name of the object passed as `dataset` in the calling environment**.\n2. Use `substitute()` to get the expression used for `dataset`, then `deparse()` to convert it to a string.\n3. Set the `name` attribute of the result.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = NULL,\n  dir = inspect_log_dir()\n) {\n  # Capture default name if not supplied\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  \n  check_dataset(dataset)\n  dataset$id <- seq_len(nrow(dataset))\n\n  res <- structure(\n    dataset,\n    class = c(\"task\", class(tibble::new_tibble(list())))\n  )\n\n  attr(res, \"dir\") <- dir\n  attr(res, \"name\") <- name\n\n  res\n}\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```r\neval <- tibble::tibble(a = 1:3)\nx <- task_create(dataset = eval)\n\nattr(x, \"name\")  # [1] \"eval\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `substitute(dataset)` captures the expression provided as the `dataset` argument.\n- `deparse()` converts it to a character string.\n- If the user provides `name = \"something_else\"`, that is used instead.\n\nThis approach is robust and works for typical R usage.",

There are two main approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 1: Use `position_jitter()` in `geom_point()`**\n\n```r\nggplot(your_data, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0))\n```\n\n- `width` (e.g., 0.1) controls *x-axis* jitter.\n- `height = 0` means *no y-axis* jitter.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 2: Use `position_jitterx()` (ggplot2 v3.4.0+)**\n\nIf you have a recent version of ggplot2 (>= 3.4.0), you can use the dedicated `position_jitterx()`:\n\n```r\nggplot(your_data, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitterx(width = 0.1))\n```\n- Only x-axis is jittered.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Function                  | X Jitter | Y Jitter                   | Example                                |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `position_jitter()`       | Yes      | Only if `height` > 0       | `position_jitter(width=0.1, height=0)` |\n| `position_jitterx()`      | Yes      | No                         | `position_jitterx(width=0.1)`          |\n\n---\n\n**Example with built-in data:**\n```r\nggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0))\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n> Use `geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = ..., height = 0))`  \n> or, if available, `geom_point(position = position_jitterx(width = ...))`",

The issue here arises because the default argument `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` is evaluated **before** argument matching substitutes `dataset` within the function body, not at the point of function call.\n\n**What's happening:**\n\n- If `name` is **not provided** by the user, the default is evaluated (`deparse(substitute(dataset))`).\n- `substitute(dataset)` gives you whatever the `dataset` argument sees **after matching**, i.e., the **argument's expression**.\n- But, if the user **adds anything explicitly to `dataset`** (like piping, or creating within the call), or if you get an object as an argument (as in your case), `substitute(dataset)` gives you the _object itself_, not its name, unless it was a symbol in the call.\n\n**Why does it resolve to the full structure?**\n\nIf you call\n\n```r\ntask_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n```\n\nthen `substitute(dataset)` is the **symbol** `simple_addition`, and `deparse()` gives \"simple_addition\" as desired.

The issue here arises because the default argument `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` is evaluated **before** argument matching substitutes `dataset` within the function body, not at the point of function call.\n\n**What's happening:**\n\n- If `name` is **not provided** by the user, the default is evaluated (`deparse(substitute(dataset))`).\n- `substitute(dataset)` gives you whatever the `dataset` argument sees **after matching**, i.e., the **argument's expression**.\n- But, if the user **adds anything explicitly to `dataset`** (like piping, or creating within the call), or if you get an object as an argument (as in your case), `substitute(dataset)` gives you the _object itself_, not its name, unless it was a symbol in the call.\n\n**Why does it resolve to the full structure?**\n\nIf you call\n\n```r\ntask_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n```\n\nthen `substitute(dataset)` is the **symbol** `simple_addition`, and `deparse()` gives \"simple_addition\" as desired. BUT! If the user sets `dataset = simple_addition` or doesn't name it, sometimes R will replace it with the **evaluated object** rather than the symbol, especially in cases like `dataset = some_expression` or in non-interactive use.\n\nBut when you do, say,\n\n```r\ntask_create(data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4))\n```\n\nthen `substitute(dataset)` is the call `data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)`, so you get that as the name.\n\nBut **sometimes**, depending on how arguments are given, e.g., in your strange output above, you end up substituting to the whole object.\n\n---\n\n## **How to robustly get the variable name callers used?**\n\nYou need to work with `substitute()` **within the function body**, not in the argument default. You can do this by setting `name = NULL` in the arguments, and then checking for it inside.\n\n### **Solution:**\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n    if (is.null(name)) {\n        name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n    }\n    # ... rest of your code\n    print(name)  # For testing\n}\n```\n\n### **Usage Examples:**\n\n```r\n# Will print \"simple_addition\"\ntsk <- task_create(simple_addition)\n\n# Will print \"data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)\"\ntsk <- task_create(data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4))\n\n# Will print \"tmp\"\ntmp <- data.frame(a = 1)\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = tmp)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Extra: Making It Even Safer (for quoted/unquoted input)**\n\nIf your users might do *really complex* things, and you just want the _symbol_ if and only if a symbol was passed, you can check for that:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n    if (is.null(name)) {\n        dataset_sub <- substitute(dataset)\n        if (is.symbol(dataset_sub)) {\n            name <- as.character(dataset_sub)\n        } else {\n            name <- deparse(dataset_sub)\n        }\n    }\n    # ... rest\n    print(name)\n}\n```\n\nBut in almost all practical cases, just using `deparse(substitute(dataset))` inside the function body (not as the argument default) will do what you want.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n**Don't use `deparse(substitute(dataset))` in the argument list.**  \n**Use it inside the function body, after checking if `name` was provided.**\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n    if (is.null(name))\n        name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n    # ... rest of your function\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n- [Advanced R: Non-Standard Evaluation (NSE)](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/evaluation.html#substitute)\n- [Why does substitute() sometimes give the value, not the symbol?

This gives you the symbol.\n\n#### Example\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  print(name)\n}\n\ntask_create(simple_addition)\n# [1] \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\n**It works!**\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Don't set `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` in the function args.\n- Instead, set `name = NULL`, and if it is `NULL`, set `name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))` inside the function.\n- This gives you `\"simple_addition\"` as the default.\n\n---\n\n#### If you want just the symbol without quotes, adjust accordingly:\n\n- `symbol <- substitute(dataset)`\n- `'simple_addition'` = `deparse(symbol)`\n\nBut usually, `\"simple_addition\"` suffices for this usage.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMove the `deparse(substitute(dataset))` into the function body after testing for missing name.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a ready-to-copy function!\n***\n[Criterion]: The `name` default is evaluated lazily, and something else results in `dataset` being evaluated before `name` is. `name` must be evaluated early in the function, e.g. using `force(name)`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission correctly identifies that the problem is caused by the evaluation order - when `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` is used as a default argument, it's evaluated after `dataset` already contains the full data structure.\n\n2. The submission proposes a solution that moves the `deparse(substitute(dataset))` logic inside the function body rather than in the argument list, using a conditional:\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n3. However, the submission **does not mention using `force(name)`** which was specifically mentioned in the criterion. The solution in the submission uses a different approach that handles the default value inside the function body instead of forcing evaluation.\n\nThe submission provides a working solution to the problem, but it doesn't use the specific technique (`force(name)`) mentioned in the criterion. While the proposed approach is valid and would work, it doesn't meet the specific requirement in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies that the issue involves using `session$ns` instead of creating a new namespace function with `NS(id)` inside the module server.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies that this is a namespace issue related to nested modules. It explains that when calling `innerServer(\"inner1\")` from within `outerServer`, the actual ID needs the parent module prefix (\"outer1-inner1\").\n\nThe submission correctly recommends using `session$ns` to generate namespaces for dynamically created UI elements within the `renderUI` function:\n```r\nverbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\nplotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n```\n\nThis solution aligns with the criterion, which states that the issue is using `NS(id)` instead of `session$ns`. The submission correctly identifies that `session$ns` maintains the proper hierarchical relationship with parent modules, ensuring fully-qualified namespaces.\n\nHowever, there's one minor difference: the submission replaces individual uses of `ns(...)` with `session$ns(...)` rather than replacing the line `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` as mentioned in the criterion. Both approaches would work in practice, but the latter is more elegant.\n\nOverall, the submission correctly addresses the core issue identified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

                  "text": "You're right: this is a **namespace** problem, but it's subtle because it happens in an *extra* layer due to the nesting.\n\n### Problem explained\n\nWhen you call `innerServer(\"inner1\")` from **within** `outerServer`, the intended `inputId` for the inner module is actually `\"outer1-inner1\"`, **not** just `\"inner1\"`. Likewise, all outputs generated by `innerServer` should end up namespaced as `\"outer1-inner1-...\"`. The same applies for `\"inner2\"` and `\"inner3\"`.\n\nBut in `innerServer`, when you call `moduleServer(id, ...)`, inside that, you construct a new `ns <- NS(id)` and generate outputs like `output$someTextGenerated` and so on, using e.g. `ns(\"someTextGenerated\")` as their IDs.\n\n**In this case, you want to use** `session$ns()` **to namespace outputs generated at runtime, not a new (potentially incorrect) `NS()` object.**\n\n### Solution\n\nIn server code within a `moduleServer`, the correct way to namespace dynamically-generated outputs is with `session$ns`, not a new `NS()`.\n\n**Change this:**\n```r\nns <- NS(id)\n...\nverbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\"))\nplotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n```\n\n**To this:**\n```r\nverbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\"))\nplotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n```\n\nSo, your new `innerServer` becomes:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n        ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Full working code\n\nHere is your app, corrected:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x = t.x, y = t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data = t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**Always use `session$ns()` to namespace UI elements that are generated during `renderUI()` inside a module.**\n\n---\n\nIf you need a more detailed explanation, check out [Module Server Functions and Namespacing](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html) in the Shiny documentation.",

Specifically, you're **double-namespacing** your inner modules in some places, which causes `output$theChart` and others to not get the right IDs.\n\n### What's going on?\n\n- In your `outer_UI`, you write `inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))` (where `ns <- NS(id)`). So the ID becomes something like `outer1-inner1`.\n- In `outerServer`, you call `innerServer(\"inner1\")`. So the ID becomes just `inner1`, **without** the `outer1-` prefix, breaking the linkage between UI and server.\n\n#### Also:  \nWithin the server function, `ns <- NS(id)`, but`moduleServer` already handles namespacing for you inside its scope—the `session$ns` function.\n\n**The takeaway:**  \n- For **module UI**, apply your parent `ns(\"child\")`  \n- For **module server**, just use `\"child\"`—`moduleServer` will handle namespacing automatically within its scope.\n\n## How to fix\n\n### 1. In `outerServer`, use the same (parent) `id` as for the server:\n\n```r\ninnerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n```\n\nBut what is `ns` in the server? It is `session$ns`. So write:\n\n```r\ninnerServer(session$ns(\"inner1\"))\n```\n\nOr, better:  \n**Pass plain `\"inner1\"`, but in your UI use `ns(\"inner1\")`:**\n\n```r\n# UI:\ncolumn(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\")))\n\n# Server:\ninnerServer(\"inner1\")  # not session$ns(\"inner1\")\n```\n\nBecause within the server module, `moduleServer(id, ...)` already adds the correct namespace!\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Specifically, you're **double-namespacing** your inner modules in some places, which causes `output$theChart` and others to not get the right IDs.\n\n### What's going on?\n\n- In your `outer_UI`, you write `inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))` (where `ns <- NS(id)`). So the ID becomes something like `outer1-inner1`.\n- In `outerServer`, you call `innerServer(\"inner1\")`. So the ID becomes just `inner1`, **without** the `outer1-` prefix, breaking the linkage between UI and server.\n\n#### Also:  \nWithin the server function, `ns <- NS(id)`, but`moduleServer` already handles namespacing for you inside its scope—the `session$ns` function.\n\n**The takeaway:**  \n- For **module UI**, apply your parent `ns(\"child\")`  \n- For **module server**, just use `\"child\"`—`moduleServer` will handle namespacing automatically within its scope.\n\n## How to fix\n\n### 1. In `outerServer`, use the same (parent) `id` as for the server:\n\n```r\ninnerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n```\n\nBut what is `ns` in the server? It is `session$ns`.

              "text": "Great question! This is a somewhat common issue when you rely on a GitHub package whose **DESCRIPTION** name (`Package:` field) doesn't match the GitHub repo name (and sometimes, the GitHub org isn't the default `cran/`).\n\nLet's unpack the specific causes and the solution.\n\n---\n\n## What's Happening?\n\n### 1. `Imports`/`Depends`\n\n- **You specify** `Imports: spatialstuff` in `DESCRIPTION`. This says: \"I depend on an R package with name 'spatialstuff' as per its DESCRIPTION file.\"\n\n### 2. `Remotes`\n\n- **You specify** `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff`. This says: \"Please install 'spatialstuff' from the org/spatial-Stuff repository on GitHub.\"\n  - The `Remotes:` line is only necessary because this package isn't on CRAN (or you specifically need a dev version).\n\n### 3. Case Sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive** internally (so `spatialstuff` and `SpatialStuff` are considered the same package). However, GitHub repo names *are* case-sensitive and may not match the R package name.\n\n### 4. What Goes Wrong?\n\n- **Error**: When the pak installation process tries to install dependencies:\n  - It looks for a package called `spatialstuff` **on CRAN** (that's default).\n  - Because `Remotes:` tells it to look at `org/spatial-Stuff`, it fetches that GitHub repo.\n  - **BUT:** If that repo's **DESCRIPTION** doesn't have `Package: spatialstuff` exactly (maybe `spatial-Stuff`, or some other mismatch, or even incorrect casing), or something else goes wrong in mapping, pak can't resolve this dependency.\n- This error often comes up if:\n  1. The `Package:` field of the GitHub repo is not `spatialstuff` (e.g., it has the wrong case or a dash in it).\n  2. There is some caching or fetching problem in the pak process, sometimes exacerbated by how GitHub handles case and renames.\n\n---\n\n## How to Solve\n\n### 1. **Check the Dependent Package**\n\n- **Go to**: https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\n- **Check** its `DESCRIPTION` file.\n- The `Package:` field *must be exactly* `spatialstuff`\n- If it is, good!\n\n> If it's **not**, ask the maintainers to fix it (it's a best practice for the DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field to be all lowercase, no dashes, as per R packaging standards).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes`**\n\nYou are correct to include:\n\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nBut remember: when you run `pak::pkg_install()` or `devtools::install_deps()`, they first resolve `Imports` by package name, then see in `Remotes` if that matches.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Alternatives/Workarounds**\n\nIf you have no control over the package at all, but you know its `Package:` field is something like `spatial-Stuff` (with a dash, *not standard for R packages*), you'll hit problems. Some package managers might try to \"fix up\" the name, but many won't.\n\n#### **Solution: Fork and Patch**\n\n- Fork the repo.\n- Edit the `DESCRIPTION` to set `Package: spatialstuff`\n- Install from your fork using `Remotes`.\n\n#### **Solution: Pre-install in Workflow**\n\nIf your CI (pkgdown, GHA, etc.) fails during dependency plan, try pre-installing the dependency from your `before_install` or `before_script`:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n\n- name: Install spatialstuff\n  run: |\n    Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\n\nBut: This will only work if the `Package:` field matches.\n\n#### **Validate Supported Package Name**\n\nR's package name spec: \"`[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\\.]*`\" (letters, numbers, dot, no dash!).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Why Does `pak` Fail, not `remotes`?**\n\n`remotes` is sloppier in resolution, `pak` is more strict.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n- The problem is *almost always* the **DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field doesn't exactly match what you have in `Imports:`**.\n- The package name must be all lowercase, no dash, and match R's conventions.\n- If you can't change the upstream package, you may need to fork it, fix the name, and install from your fork.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nCheck:\n\n1. `org/spatial-Stuff`'s `DESCRIPTION` for correct `Package:` field.\n2. Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes` fields.\n3. If all looks correct and it still fails, try pre-installing in GHA.\n\nIf you give me the actual repo and org, I can inspect and give even more targeted advice!\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you find a mismatch in the `Package:` field! That is almost certainly the root cause.**"

There is some caching or fetching problem in the pak process, sometimes exacerbated by how GitHub handles case and renames.\n\n---\n\n## How to Solve\n\n### 1. **Check the Dependent Package**\n\n- **Go to**: https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\n- **Check** its `DESCRIPTION` file.\n- The `Package:` field *must be exactly* `spatialstuff`\n- If it is, good!\n\n> If it's **not**, ask the maintainers to fix it (it's a best practice for the DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field to be all lowercase, no dashes, as per R packaging standards).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes`**\n\nYou are correct to include:\n\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nBut remember: when you run `pak::pkg_install()` or `devtools::install_deps()`, they first resolve `Imports` by package name, then see in `Remotes` if that matches.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Alternatives/Workarounds**\n\nIf you have no control over the package at all, but you know its `Package:` field is something like `spatial-Stuff` (with a dash, *not standard for R packages*), you'll hit problems. Some package managers might try to \"fix up\" the name, but many won't.\n\n#### **Solution: Fork and Patch**\n\n- Fork the repo.\n- Edit the `DESCRIPTION` to set `Package: spatialstuff`\n- Install from your fork using `Remotes`.\n\n#### **Solution: Pre-install in Workflow**\n\nIf your CI (pkgdown, GHA, etc.) fails during dependency plan, try pre-installing the dependency from your `before_install` or `before_script`:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n\n- name: Install spatialstuff\n  run: |\n    Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\n\nBut: This will only work if the `Package:` field matches.\n\n#### **Validate Supported Package Name**\n\nR's package name spec: \"`[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\\.]*`\" (letters, numbers, dot, no dash!).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Why Does `pak` Fail, not `remotes`?**\n\n`remotes` is sloppier in resolution, `pak` is more strict.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n- The problem is *almost always* the **DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field doesn't exactly match what you have in `Imports:`**.\n- The package name must be all lowercase, no dash, and match R's conventions.\n- If you can't change the upstream package, you may need to fork it, fix the name, and install from your fork.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nCheck:\n\n1. `org/spatial-Stuff`'s `DESCRIPTION` for correct `Package:` field.\n2. Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes` fields.\n3. If all looks correct and it still fails, try pre-installing in GHA.\n\nIf you give me the actual repo and org, I can inspect and give even more targeted advice!\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you find a mismatch in the `Package:` field! That is almost certainly the root cause.**"

However, GitHub repo names *are* case-sensitive and may not match the R package name.\n\n### 4. What Goes Wrong?\n\n- **Error**: When the pak installation process tries to install dependencies:\n  - It looks for a package called `spatialstuff` **on CRAN** (that's default).\n  - Because `Remotes:` tells it to look at `org/spatial-Stuff`, it fetches that GitHub repo.\n  - **BUT:** If that repo's **DESCRIPTION** doesn't have `Package: spatialstuff` exactly (maybe `spatial-Stuff`, or some other mismatch, or even incorrect casing), or something else goes wrong in mapping, pak can't resolve this dependency.\n- This error often comes up if:\n  1. The `Package:` field of the GitHub repo is not `spatialstuff` (e.g., it has the wrong case or a dash in it).\n  2. There is some caching or fetching problem in the pak process, sometimes exacerbated by how GitHub handles case and renames.\n\n---\n\n## How to Solve\n\n### 1. **Check the Dependent Package**\n\n- **Go to**: https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\n- **Check** its `DESCRIPTION` file.\n- The `Package:` field *must be exactly* `spatialstuff`\n- If it is, good!\n\n> If it's **not**, ask the maintainers to fix it (it's a best practice for the DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field to be all lowercase, no dashes, as per R packaging standards).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes`**\n\nYou are correct to include:\n\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nBut remember: when you run `pak::pkg_install()` or `devtools::install_deps()`, they first resolve `Imports` by package name, then see in `Remotes` if that matches.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Alternatives/Workarounds**\n\nIf you have no control over the package at all, but you know its `Package:` field is something like `spatial-Stuff` (with a dash, *not standard for R packages*), you'll hit problems. Some package managers might try to \"fix up\" the name, but many won't.\n\n#### **Solution: Fork and Patch**\n\n- Fork the repo.\n- Edit the `DESCRIPTION` to set `Package: spatialstuff`\n- Install from your fork using `Remotes`.\n\n#### **Solution: Pre-install in Workflow**\n\nIf your CI (pkgdown, GHA, etc.) fails during dependency plan, try pre-installing the dependency from your `before_install` or `before_script`:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n\n- name: Install spatialstuff\n  run: |\n    Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\n\nBut: This will only work if the `Package:` field matches.\n\n#### **Validate Supported Package Name**\n\nR's package name spec: \"`[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\\.]*`\" (letters, numbers, dot, no dash!).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Why Does `pak` Fail, not `remotes`?**\n\n`remotes` is sloppier in resolution, `pak` is more strict.\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n\n- The problem is *almost always* the **DESCRIPTION's `Package:` field doesn't exactly match what you have in `Imports:`**.\n- The package name must be all lowercase, no dash, and match R's conventions.\n- If you can't change the upstream package, you may need to fork it, fix the name, and install from your fork.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nCheck:\n\n1. `org/spatial-Stuff`'s `DESCRIPTION` for correct `Package:` field.\n2. Your `DESCRIPTION` and `Remotes` fields.\n3. If all looks correct and it still fails, try pre-installing in GHA.\n\nIf you give me the actual repo and org, I can inspect and give even more targeted advice!\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you find a mismatch in the `Package:` field! That is almost certainly the root cause.**"

This is a somewhat common issue when you rely on a GitHub package whose **DESCRIPTION** name (`Package:` field) doesn't match the GitHub repo name (and sometimes, the GitHub org isn't the default `cran/`).\n\nLet's unpack the specific causes and the solution.\n\n---\n\n## What's Happening?\n\n### 1. `Imports`/`Depends`\n\n- **You specify** `Imports: spatialstuff` in `DESCRIPTION`.

Let's break down what's happening, **why** it happens, and **how to fix it**.\n\n---\n\n## **What’s Happening?**\n\n- In your `DESCRIPTION`, under `Imports:`, you list the **R package name**:  \n  ```r\n  Imports:\n    spatialstuff\n  ```\n- Under `Remotes:`, you specify the GitHub repo:  \n  ```\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n- The actual **raw GitHub repository** is named `spatial-Stuff` (note the capital \"S\" and the hyphen), but the R package **internally** is called `spatialstuff`.\n\nWhen using a tool like **pak** (or `remotes`/`devtools`), the following process happens:\n\n  1. It looks at the **Imports** and realizes it needs `spatialstuff`.\n  2. On CRAN, it does **not** find `spatialstuff` (presumably not published).\n  3. It looks at **Remotes** and tries to install `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n  4. **Some tools match `Imports` to `Remotes` using package _names_**, but the \"Remotes\" is always as `\"org/repo\"` (repo may not match the package).\n  5. If the tools do not handle this correctly, they might fail to match your `Imports: spatialstuff` with `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\nThis is especially a problem with **case sensitivity** or if the **repo name** differs from the **package name**.\n\n---\n\n## **The Error Message**\n\n```\nCan't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\nThis means `pak` tried to find a package called `spatialstuff` (as requested in Imports) and could not find it, either on CRAN or among the sources provided by your Remotes.\n\n---\n\n## **Root Cause**\n\n- The repo `org/spatial-Stuff` **contains** the R package `spatialstuff`, but the R **repo name** (`spatial-Stuff`) and the package name (`spatialstuff`) differ in case/hyphens.\n- Some package installation tools will search CRAN for `spatialstuff` if it can't find a matching repo in Remotes with a **matching package name**.\n\n---\n\n## **Solution**\n\n### **1. Use the `@` syntax in `Remotes`**\n\nYou can clarify the linkage in your `Remotes` by specifying the subdir (if needed), **but most importantly, as long as the DESCRIPTION in the remote repo has `Package: spatialstuff`, things _should_ work**.\n\n### **2. Check Capitalization and Spelling in your DESCRIPTION**\n- The value in `Imports:` must **match the internal package name** in the remote's DESCRIPTION.\n- The value in `Remotes:` must match the **GitHub org/repo**, which may have different capitalization or hyphens.\n\n**This is correct:**\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n### **3. Ensure the Remote Repository Has a Valid DESCRIPTION**\n\nThe GitHub repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` must have a `DESCRIPTION` file with  \n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nat the top. Installation tools scan this file to find the actual package name after downloading from GitHub.\n\n### **4. Workaround for Package Cache Issues**\n\n- Sometimes if you previously installed an early (perhaps broken) version of the package, or if there were failed installations, package caches can get confused.\n- Try running  \n  ```\n  pak::pak(clean = TRUE)\n  # or for devtools\n  devtools::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE, upgrade=\"never\", force=TRUE)\n  ```\n\n### **5. If All Else Fails: Use a Direct Reference**\n\n- You can install the dependency directly in your CI/CD by running, e.g.:\n  ```yaml\n  - name: Install spatial-Stuff package\n    run: |\n      Rscript -e \"remotes::install_github('org/spatial-Stuff')\"\n  ```\n  This ensures it's installed before any other. This is a workaround, and **should not** be necessary if your DESCRIPTION is set up correctly.\n\n---\n\n## **Why is pak pickier?**\n\nThe new `pak` tool uses a *solver* that tries to create an internal map of package names to sources. If it cannot match `spatialstuff` (the package name) to what it knows about the remotes (which are enumerated as `org/spatial-Stuff`, `org/spatial-Stuff2`, etc.), this error can occur, especially if the repo name and package name don't match.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Actions**\n\n- **Double check the package name** in the remote's DESCRIPTION is `spatialstuff`.\n- Your `Imports` must exactly match that package name.\n- Your `Remotes` should specify the **repo**, even if the case/hyphenation is different.\n- Most tools _should_ resolve this. If not, it might be a bug or quirk in the used package installer (`pak` in this case).\n- As a workaround, try explicitly installing the dependency in you CI before the main package, **or** use the `devtools`/`remotes` workflows for pkgdown.\n- If this remains an issue, consider [filing an issue with pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues).\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R Packages book: Github Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-matters.html#github-packages)\n- [pak docs](https://pak.r-lib.org/)\n- [devtools::install_github manual](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nAs long as your `Imports` matches the actual package name *inside* the repo and your `Remotes` gives the repo URL, everything should work. If `pak` still cannot resolve the dependency, this is a tool quirk (or bug), and using remotes/devtools for installation, or pre-installing the package in CI, can work around it.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Ensuring the remote repository has a valid DESCRIPTION file\n4. Workarounds for package cache issues\n5. Using direct references as a last resort\n\nThe critical solution of using `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff` in the Remotes field is not mentioned anywhere in the answer. This format explicitly tells R that the package named \"spatialstuff\" should be fetched from the GitHub repository \"org/spatial-Stuff\", which would solve the problem described in the task.\n\nWhile the answer covers many aspects of dependency management and is informative, it misses the specific solution required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

Use the `@` syntax in `Remotes`**\n\nYou can clarify the linkage in your `Remotes` by specifying the subdir (if needed), **but most importantly, as long as the DESCRIPTION in the remote repo has `Package: spatialstuff`, things _should_ work**.\n\n### **2. Check Capitalization and Spelling in your DESCRIPTION**\n- The value in `Imports:` must **match the internal package name** in the remote's DESCRIPTION.\n- The value in `Remotes:` must match the **GitHub org/repo**, which may have different capitalization or hyphens.\n\n**This is correct:**\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n### **3. Ensure the Remote Repository Has a Valid DESCRIPTION**\n\nThe GitHub repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` must have a `DESCRIPTION` file with  \n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nat the top. Installation tools scan this file to find the actual package name after downloading from GitHub.\n\n### **4. Workaround for Package Cache Issues**\n\n- Sometimes if you previously installed an early (perhaps broken) version of the package, or if there were failed installations, package caches can get confused.\n- Try running  \n  ```\n  pak::pak(clean = TRUE)\n  # or for devtools\n  devtools::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE, upgrade=\"never\", force=TRUE)\n  ```\n\n### **5. If All Else Fails: Use a Direct Reference**\n\n- You can install the dependency directly in your CI/CD by running, e.g.:\n  ```yaml\n  - name: Install spatial-Stuff package\n    run: |\n      Rscript -e \"remotes::install_github('org/spatial-Stuff')\"\n  ```\n  This ensures it's installed before any other. This is a workaround, and **should not** be necessary if your DESCRIPTION is set up correctly.\n\n---\n\n## **Why is pak pickier?**\n\nThe new `pak` tool uses a *solver* that tries to create an internal map of package names to sources. If it cannot match `spatialstuff` (the package name) to what it knows about the remotes (which are enumerated as `org/spatial-Stuff`, `org/spatial-Stuff2`, etc.), this error can occur, especially if the repo name and package name don't match.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Actions**\n\n- **Double check the package name** in the remote's DESCRIPTION is `spatialstuff`.\n- Your `Imports` must exactly match that package name.\n- Your `Remotes` should specify the **repo**, even if the case/hyphenation is different.\n- Most tools _should_ resolve this. If not, it might be a bug or quirk in the used package installer (`pak` in this case).\n- As a workaround, try explicitly installing the dependency in you CI before the main package, **or** use the `devtools`/`remotes` workflows for pkgdown.\n- If this remains an issue, consider [filing an issue with pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues).\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R Packages book: Github Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-matters.html#github-packages)\n- [pak docs](https://pak.r-lib.org/)\n- [devtools::install_github manual](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nAs long as your `Imports` matches the actual package name *inside* the repo and your `Remotes` gives the repo URL, everything should work. If `pak` still cannot resolve the dependency, this is a tool quirk (or bug), and using remotes/devtools for installation, or pre-installing the package in CI, can work around it.",

But in your setup, the main problem is that you are **creating the `foo` method in `initialize()` by dynamically assigning to `self[[\"foo\"]]`**, which makes it hard (or impossible) for subclass methods (like in `Child`) to properly \"override\" or use `super$foo()`.\n\n**Key Problems:**\n- Dynamically \"adding\" a method in the constructor (`initialize`) breaks the usual R6 method resolution and `super$method()` mechanics.\n- R6 expects all methods to be declared in the `public` list up front for inheritance and super calls to work reliably.\n- Object locking is only relevant if you try to *replace* existing bindings; but here, you're dynamically creating a new one then trying to override.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix It**\n\n**Solution:**  \n**Declare `foo` as a method normally in `public = list(...)`.**  \nIf you need to change or customize `foo` at runtime, you can do so by mutating it, but then you lose inheritance/super.  \nFor subclassing, always declare the method up front.\n\n### **Working Example:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(R6)\n\nParent <- R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo in Parent\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo in Child, calling super:\")\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> foo in Child, calling super:\n#> foo in Parent\n```\n\n---\n\n### **If You REALLY Need Dynamic Assignment**\n\nIf you *must* add dynamic methods, use *another* name, or use composition, not inheritance, or accept that `super` won't work with such methods.\n\nBut if you do:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = NULL,\n    initialize = function() {\n      self$foo <- function() {\n        print(\"foo in Parent\")\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\n# Can't really \"override\" foo in the subclass easily this way. \n```\n\nBut then `super$foo()` won't work, because it's not a function at the class level!\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n**Best Practice:**\n- **Define all methods that need inheritance/\"override\" in the `public` list, not dynamically inside `initialize`.**\n- Use dynamic assignment only for fields, or for methods if you don't need inheritance or `super`.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n\n- [R6: Super, inheritance, and method overriding](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#inheritance)\n- [R6 GitHub issues about dynamic method overriding](https://github.com/r-lib/R6/issues/228)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n> **Declare methods you want to override up front in `public = list()`. Do NOT add methods dynamically in `initialize` if you want subclasses and `super` to work.**\n\nLet me know if you need a workaround for a specific dynamic method pattern!\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Instead, the submission:\n\n1. Explains that the error occurs because R6 binds methods as locked when using `lock_objects = FALSE`\n2. Suggests solving the problem by declaring methods in the `public` list upfront rather than dynamically\n3. Provides alternative approaches that avoid the need to change locked bindings\n\nWhile the submission provides helpful information about R6 classes and inheritance in general, it completely misses the specific solution required by the criterion - using `unlockBinding()`.

This creates a conflict when inheritance and dynamic assignment meet.\n\n### What's causing the error?\n\n- When a `Child` object is created, the constructor from `Parent` runs, which tries to assign a function to `self[[\"foo\"]]`.\n- But the `foo` binding was already created by the `Child` class definition (it's *inherited* and/or *defined* in the class generator).\n- So, later attempts to reassign `foo` inside `initialize()` fail because the binding is locked (`Error in self$foo <- ... cannot change value of locked binding`).\n\n## Solutions\n\n### **A. Avoid dynamic assignment** (recommended)\n\nIf possible, **don't assign methods dynamically**. Define all your methods in the class generator. You can always override methods in subclasses:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print('and bar')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n#> [1] \"and bar\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **B. If dynamic assignment is necessary, do NOT define `foo` in the subclass's public block**\n\nOnly assign (or override) `foo` *after* the object has been created, **NOT** as a regular class member.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"foo from parent\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      # dynamically override foo\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        super$foo()\n        print(\"foo from child\")\n      }\n    }\n    # do NOT define foo = ... here!\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo from parent\"\n#> [1] \"foo from child\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **C. If you must sometimes assign dynamically and sometimes statically,** you need to clear or avoid conflicts.\nBut this gets hacky and fragile—it's usually a design smell.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Parent method assignment   | Child method assignment  | Safe?           |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| defined in class generator| defined in generator    | ✅ Yes          |\n| defined in class generator| dynamically in `init`   | ❓ Error-prone* |\n| dynamically in `init`     | defined in generator    | ❌ No (your case)|\n| dynamically in `init`     | dynamically in `init`   | ✅ Yes          |\n\n(*be careful about binding locking)\n\n---\n\n## **Takeaway**\n\n- **Best:** Use class generator for method definitions unless you have a compelling reason.\n- **If you must assign dynamically, only assign/override dynamically elsewhere**\n- DO NOT mix static (generator) and dynamic assignment for the same method name.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Code Fixed (Option B):**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        super$foo()\n        print('bar')\n      }\n    }\n    # No foo definition here!\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n#> [1] \"bar\"\n```\n\n---\n\n**Rule of thumb:**  \n> *Don't define the same method both dynamically (via `$init` or runtime assignment) and statically (via the class public list) in the inheritance chain.*"

This creates a conflict when inheritance and dynamic assignment meet.\n\n### What's causing the error?\n\n- When a `Child` object is created, the constructor from `Parent` runs, which tries to assign a function to `self[[\"foo\"]]`.\n- But the `foo` binding was already created by the `Child` class definition (it's *inherited* and/or *defined* in the class generator).\n- So, later attempts to reassign `foo` inside `initialize()` fail because the binding is locked (`Error in self$foo <- ... cannot change value of locked binding`).\n\n## Solutions\n\n### **A. Avoid dynamic assignment** (recommended)\n\nIf possible, **don't assign methods dynamically**. Define all your methods in the class generator. You can always override methods in subclasses:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print('and bar')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n#> [1] \"and bar\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **B. If dynamic assignment is necessary, do NOT define `foo` in the subclass's public block**\n\nOnly assign (or override) `foo` *after* the object has been created, **NOT** as a regular class member.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"foo from parent\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      # dynamically override foo\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        super$foo()\n        print(\"foo from child\")\n      }\n    }\n    # do NOT define foo = ... here!\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo from parent\"\n#> [1] \"foo from child\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **C.

This tries to set the default of `chat` to the outer function's value. **But** when the inner function is called, if you don't specify the `chat` argument, R tries to evaluate `chat = chat`, but now `chat` refers to itself (the inner function's argument), *not* the outer scope, thus causing the recursive promise.\n\nThis is a well-known pitfall! In short: **default argument evaluation uses the current scope, not enclosing environments**.\n\n### How to fix\n\nThere are three main ways:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Use a different name for the inner function's argument\n\nIf you want to allow override of the outer `chat` object, use a different name in the inner function:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, custom_chat = chat) {\n    ch <- custom_chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow the default (`custom_chat = chat`) refers to the outer scope's `chat`.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Use missing() checking\n\nDon't provide a default, but \"fall back\" to the closure if not provided:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_arg) {\n    effective_chat <- if (missing(chat_arg)) chat else chat_arg\n    ch <- effective_chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand call with `chat_arg=...` if overriding.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Omit the \"chat\" argument in the inner function entirely\n\nIf you **never** plan to override it at call time, just don't have a `chat` argument:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou cannot have a function argument default to itself with `chat = chat` unless they refer to different environments (they don't, in this case).  \n**Best practice:** If you want to refer to an outer variable, use a different name for the argument (`custom_chat=chat` for example).\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n- [Advanced R: Lazy Evaluation – Default arguments](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#default-arguments)\n- ?function in R docs, especially regarding \"default values are evaluated at the time of function call\"."

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies the issue with the `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function and provides the right solution.\n\nThe submission does correctly identify the core issue: the reactive expressions and `output$plot` are defined outside the server function, when they should be inside it. The submission explains:\n\n1. The main problem of defining server logic outside the `shinyApp()` structure\n2. That reactive expressions need to be inside the server function\n3. The issue with referencing `input` variables outside the server function\n4. Some additional notes about reactive usage\n\nThe solution provided in the submission is comprehensive, showing a complete rewrite of the app with all reactive logic moved inside the server function.\n\nThe criterion specifically mentions moving the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, which the submission explicitly covers. The submitted solution correctly shows how to:\n- Define a proper server function\n- Move the reactive data filtering inside it\n- Include the plot rendering inside the server function\n\nThe submitted answer goes beyond the minimum requirements by explaining the underlying concepts and providing a more comprehensive solution than the criterion example.\n\nGRADE: C",

Also, you don't really need these separate wrappers for each input; you can just use `input$condition` directly inside the `server`.\n\n#### 4. **Filtered Data: vector comparison**\nIn your filter: `CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition`,  \n- That should be: `CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition()`  \n- Or, even better, `CKD_STAGE == input$condition`\n- But also **`filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, ...)`** will almost never do what you want with a vector comparison, prefer `== input$condition`\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix**\n\nPut everything \"reactive\" (things that use `input$...`, `output$...`, or reactive data) **INSIDE** the `server` function.  \nBelow is a cleaned-up and working version of your app:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # If no data, don't plot\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for this selection.\")\n    )\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n**Key changes:**\n- All reactivity and output inside the `server` function.\n- Use `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` directly.\n- Validate that there is data before plotting.\n\n---\n\n## **RECOMMENDATION:**\n**Never assign `output$plot` or other `output$...` outside of the `server` function.**  \n**Never use reactives or `input$...` at top-level (global). Only use inside server.**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you have follow-up questions or see other errors!\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function.

How to fix\n\n#### Move all reactivity inside the server function\nHere's **how to rewrite your app**:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    # In case no data matches, prevent further errors\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No rows match the filter.\")\n    )\n\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n#### Notes:\n- All **reactive expressions** *and* all `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` are now **inside** `server`.\n- You don't need separate wrapper `reactive` expressions for each `input$...`. You can just use `input$...` inside your reactive expression as shown above.\n- Your previous code for `server` was only returning `output$plot`, not defining it, so Shiny had nothing to connect to your UI.\n- Added a check for `nrow(data) > 0` so that the plot doesn't error out if no data matches the user's filters.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Fix**\n- **Move all reactive code and outputs inside the server function.**\n- Reference the inputs directly inside reactive expressions.\n- `shinyApp(ui, server)` must have a well-defined `server` function.\n\n---\n\n#### For more info, see Shiny's [reactivity tutorial](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/reactivity-overview/) and the [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.posit.co/tutorial/).",

In `tidyverse`, you can use `dplyr::mutate()` and `stringr::str_replace()` for the first replacement, and `str_replace()` again for the second. Here’s how:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n    \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n    \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n  )\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result_new = appointment_key %>% \n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%        # Replace first ||\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")            # Replace (new) first || (formerly second one)\n  )\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- First `str_replace()` replaces first occurrence of `||` with `\"T\"`\n- Second `str_replace()` (on the result of first) replaces the new first occurrence of `||` (which was the second originally) with `\"A\"`\n\n**Output:**\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  referral_key appointment_key result       result_new  \n  <chr>        <chr>           <chr>        <chr>       \n1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1 4289T10410A1\n2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2 4289T10410A2\n```\n\n**Note:**  \nIf you ever need to generalize this to variable-length keys or patterns, consider using `str_split()` and `str_c()` for more control.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`\n\nThe submitted solution:\n- Correctly uses `str_replace()` twice in sequence\n- Properly escapes the pipe characters with `\\\\|\\\\|`\n- First replaces the first occurrence of `||` with \"T\"\n- Then replaces the next occurrence of `||` with \"A\"\n- Creates a new column `result_new` instead of modifying `appointment_key` directly, which is acceptable per the criterion that states \"A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`\"\n\nThe solution is conceptually correct and matches the expected approach. The only minor difference from the example in the criterion is that it creates a new column rather than modifying the existing one, but the criterion explicitly allows this variation.\n\nGRADE: C"

The submission correctly uses `semi_join` with `df2` as the first argument and `df1` as the second argument\n2. While the syntax for specifying the join columns differs (`by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\")` vs. `by = join_by(key1, key2)`), the criterion explicitly states that \"slight differences in syntax are fine\"\n3. The submission also correctly demonstrates the piped version, which the criterion says is acceptable\n4. The example and explanation clearly demonstrate understanding of what semi_join does and how it solves the problem\n\nThe submission satisfies all requirements of the criterion. While there are slight differences in syntax for specifying the join columns, this is explicitly permitted by the criterion.

Here's how you should write your test under testthat's third edition idioms:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"check_ellipses gives correct warning for unsupported argument\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    regexp = \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n**Key differences and adjustments:**\n\n- ***test_that()***: Enforce every expectation lives within a `test_that()` block (more strictly enforced in 3e).\n- **Matching argument**: Use the `regexp =` argument to explicitly specify the regular expression (the old usage, with unnamed match, still works but this is clearer and future-proof).\n- **Backticks in regex**: Modern testthat only needs backslashes if you’re matching inline backticks with regex–if double-escaped as in your original, it's fine, but single may suffice depending on your function output.  \n- **Third edition option**: If you need to be explicit (some frameworks require), set `local_edition(3)` within the test, but by default, an up-to-date testthat will use edition 3 for new packages.\n\nIf your codebase relies on old-style escaping, you can keep your double-backslashed backticks `\\\\``—but it’s often safe to present the pattern as you expect in output, e.g.:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"check_ellipses gives correct warning for unsupported argument\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    regexp = \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```\n*(Replace the string inside `regexp = \"\"` as needed to match exactly)*\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nWrap your test in `test_that()`, use `regexp =` argument in `expect_warning()`, and match the error string per your expected output. The third edition enforces test block encapsulation and makes matching output explicit."

That's okay.\n   \n3. **Lambda Syntax**\n   - Your anonymous function `\\(x) x+1` (introduced in R 4.1.0) is fine for recent versions, so this alone isn't the issue.\n\n4. **Unused argument (alist())**\n   - The error message stems from the fact that if you use a constant for `.names` without a glue expression, and you apply `across()` to only one column, it's not generally a problem *but* if you use malformed naming AND a trailing comma, it might cause internal errors in some dplyr versions.\n   \n5. **Invalid `.names` argument syntax / trailing comma**\n   - The comma after `\"x\"` (`.names = \"x\",`) is likely causing trouble because R would expect another argument (which is missing), thus possibly sending unnamed/blank args (like `alist()`) to the lambda.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix**\n\n### **Recommended Fixes**\n\n#### **A. Just add 1 to `vs` - Simpler syntax**\nIf you only want to add 1 to `vs` and keep the same column name:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\n#### **B. Use `across` for more general/useful cases**\n\n**If you want a new column (e.g. vs_plus1):**\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n**If you want to overwrite in-place:**\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1))\n```\nOr, even more simply (as above):\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\n**No need for a trailing comma!**\n```r\n... .names = \"{.col}_plus1\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| What you want               | Code                                                        |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overwrite `vs`              | `mtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)`                            |\n| Add new column vs_plus1     | `mtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x+1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))` |\n\n---\n\n## **Bonus: Generalize to Multiple Columns**\nIf you wanted to do this for several columns:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(c(vs, am), \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **Remove the trailing comma** after `.names = ...`\n- **Use a valid glue string** in `.names` (e.g. `\"{.col}_plus1\"`)\n- Or, for a single column, **just use regular mutate syntax** for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Example, working:**\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x+1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\nOr just:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\nLet me know if you have further questions!",

This would tell R CMD check that \"closest\" is intentionally used as a global variable, preventing warnings about undefined variables.\n\nThe submitted answer, however, doesn't mention this approach at all. Instead, it recommends:\n1. Check for alternative exported functions\n2. Copy the implementation into the user's own package\n3. Use the triple colon operator (`:::`) as a last resort (while noting this is discouraged)\n\nNone of these approaches matches the simple solution described in the criterion. The submission provides detailed explanations about unexported functions but misses the specific and simple fix that would solve the user's problem.\n\nThe submission is thorough in explaining the general concept of unexported functions but provides incorrect advice for this specific situation where `closest()` is actually being used through non-standard evaluation in dplyr.\n\nGRADE: I",

Here’s what’s going on, and how to address it:\n\n## Why `dplyr::closest()` doesn't work\n- The function `closest()` is **not an exported function in dplyr**’s public API.\n- Only exported functions are accessible via `dplyr::fun()`.\n- Internally, you can sometimes use non-exported functions by just calling `closest()` **if dplyr is attached** (`library(dplyr)`), or if your package’s NAMESPACE imports everything (not recommended), but this is fragile and non-standard.\n\n## Why you get lint issues/build notes\n- Code linters and R CMD check may warn or error about use of unexported functions; this is generally disallowed because the function could change or disappear without notice in future dplyr releases.\n\n## How to correctly use `dplyr::closest()` or a similar function\n\n### 1. **Check for Alternatives**\n   \nIs there a *documented, exported* function in dplyr providing the functionality you want?  \nIf yes, use it!  \nIf not, read on.\n\n### 2. **Copy the Implementation**\n\nIf you *must* use it, since `closest()` is unexported, you should:\n\n- Copy the code for `closest()` from dplyr's source, and put it in your own package under a new name, with attribution.\n- That way you’re not reliant on internal dplyr code.\n\n> **Do not use unexported internal functions from another package!**  \n> It may break at any time. Using such functions is strongly discouraged.\n\n### 3. **If You Absolutely Must Use It (not advised):**\n\nYou **could** access it via the triple colon (`:::`), *but this is even more strongly discouraged*:\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\nBut this will **fail R CMD check** and upset linters. Your package may also break when dplyr updates.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n- **Best: Copy the logic from dplyr's `closest` into your own package.**\n- **Do _not_ call `dplyr::closest()` (not exported!) or `dplyr:::closest()` (internal, subject to change).**\n- Make sure you look for any recently exported alternatives, or file an issue/feature request with dplyr if you think this should be public API.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Using the Internal Function Code\n\nIf you grab the code (current as of dplyr 1.1.4):\n\n```r\nclosest <- function(x, table) {\n  table[vec_distance(x, table, format = \"vector\") == min(vec_distance(x, table, format = \"vector\"))]\n}\n```\n\nCopy this into your own package, maybe as `my_closest()` (with any needed dependencies, e.g. `vctrs::vec_distance`), and document with a note citing dplyr as the origin.\n\n---\n\n**In short: Never depend on unexported dplyr functions in your own packages. Copy/adapt as needed.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to share what you're using `closest()` for, I may be able to suggest a stable, supported alternative!\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Or are you using a dev version or something defined internally?\n\n#### Search for the Function\n\n- Try: `ls(\"package:dplyr\", all.names = TRUE) | grep(\"closest\")`\n- Or look in the [dplyr reference manual](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).\n\nIf the function really exists but is **not exported**, it's an *internal* function, and **should not be used in your code via `dplyr::closest()` or even unqualified as `closest()`**.\n\n### 2. **If you need `closest()` logic, copy or implement it in your package**\n- If you found the code in dplyr's sources (perhaps [`vec_group_loc()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/search?q=closest) or similar), consider **copying just that code** and giving it your own function name.\n- But be sure to respect licensing, attributions, and future maintainability.\n\n### 3. **Don't Rely on Unexported Functions**\n- CRAN, good linting, and package guidelines say: **do not depend on internal, unexported functions from other packages.**\n- If the function is critical, consider opening an [issue on dplyr GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) asking about exportation.\n\n### 4. **Alternatives**\n- You may have meant a different function. For \"find the nearest/closest match,\" consider:\n    - [`dplyr::findInterval()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/findInterval.html)\n    - [`dplyr::between()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/between.html)\n    - [`dplyr::nearest` join helpers](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_nearest.html), e.g. `join_nearest()`, if using dplyr ≥ 1.1.0.\n\n**If you describe what you want \"closest\" to do, I can help you implement a canonical version!**\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- `dplyr::closest()` fails because it **is not exported** by dplyr.\n- Do **not** use unqualified `closest()` in your package; it's a lint and build problem.\n- **Best practice:** Copy the logic into your own function, or use a similar *exported* helper from dplyr or base R.\n\n**If you clarify what you want `closest()` to do, I'll help you write a suitable replacement function!**\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
