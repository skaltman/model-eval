          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly implements the logic described in the task. The task requires checking two conditions:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.integer(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") ||\n        (\n          sum(type == \"Type_I\") >= 2 &\n          (max(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) - min(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) >= 90\n        )\n    ),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n```\n\nThere's an issue with how the second condition is implemented. The submission checks if the maximum difference between any Type_I dates is at least 90 days. But the task asks for \"two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\"\n\n\"Within at least 90 days\" means the difference should be less than or equal to 90 days, not greater than or equal to 90 days. The criterion solution correctly uses `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90` to check if any consecutive dates are within 90 days of each other.\n\nAdditionally, the OR operator doesn't correctly implement the requirement. The task states both conditions need to be met (Type_II OR Type_I within 90 days), which the submission does implement correctly with the logical OR.\n\nThe mistake in interpreting the date condition (checking for dates ≥ 90 days apart rather than ≤ 90 days apart) is significant and would lead to incorrect flagging of IDs.\n\nGRADE: P",

(any(type == \"Type_II\"))  \n• Do they have at least two Type_I records separated by ≥90 days? (sum(type == \"Type_I\") ≥ 2 and max(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) - min(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) ≥ 90)\n\nThen take the logical OR of these two conditions to set your Flag:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.integer(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") ||\n        (\n          sum(type == \"Type_I\") >= 2 &\n          (max(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) - min(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) >= 90\n        )\n    ),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. group_by(ID) ensures we check conditions separately for each individual ID.\n2. any(type == \"Type_II\") is TRUE if there is at least one row with Type_II for that ID.\n3. sum(type == \"Type_I\") >= 2 checks that the ID has at least two Type_I rows.\n4. max(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) - min(date[type == \"Type_I\"]) >= 90 checks that the earliest and latest Type_I dates are at least 90 days apart.\n5. The logical OR of conditions (3) and (4) with (2) covers both criteria simultaneously.\n6. as.integer(...) turns TRUE/FALSE into 1/0 for the final Flag column.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission checks if the maximum difference between any Type_I dates is at least 90 days. But the task asks for \"two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\"\n\n\"Within at least 90 days\" means the difference should be less than or equal to 90 days, not greater than or equal to 90 days. The criterion solution correctly uses `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90` to check if any consecutive dates are within 90 days of each other.\n\nAdditionally, the OR operator doesn't correctly implement the requirement. The task states both conditions need to be met (Type_II OR Type_I within 90 days), which the submission does implement correctly with the logical OR.\n\nThe mistake in interpreting the date condition (checking for dates ≥ 90 days apart rather than ≤ 90 days apart) is significant and would lead to incorrect flagging of IDs.\n\nGRADE: P"

The essential idea is:\n\n• For each ID, determine whether there is at least one Type_II.  \n• For each ID, determine whether there are at least two Type_I visits that occur within 90 days of one another.  \n• Combine those two indicators with a logical OR to get the final flag.\n\nExample code:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  # 1. Find if this ID has any Type_II\n  summarize(\n    has_Type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # 2. Among Type_I visits only, see if any two are within 90 days\n    has_two_Type_I_within_90 = {\n      # Filter just Type_I for current ID, order by date\n      typeI_dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # Check if any adjacent pair of dates is ≤ 90 days apart\n      any(diff(typeI_dates) <= 90)\n    }\n  ) %>%\n  # 3.

After sorting, diff(typeI_dates) produces the consecutive date differences. We then check whether any of these differences is ≤ 90 days.  \n• Finally, we unify those two conditions with OR (|) and cast to integer to get a 0/1 flag."

The essential idea is:\n\n• For each ID, determine whether there is at least one Type_II.  \n• For each ID, determine whether there are at least two Type_I visits that occur within 90 days of one another.  \n• Combine those two indicators with a logical OR to get the final flag.\n\nExample code:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  # 1. Find if this ID has any Type_II\n  summarize(\n    has_Type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # 2. Among Type_I visits only, see if any two are within 90 days\n    has_two_Type_I_within_90 = {\n      # Filter just Type_I for current ID, order by date\n      typeI_dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # Check if any adjacent pair of dates is ≤ 90 days apart\n      any(diff(typeI_dates) <= 90)\n    }\n  ) %>%\n  # 3. Combine both conditions with a logical OR. Convert logical to integer 0/1.\n  mutate(Flag = as.integer(has_Type_II | has_two_Type_I_within_90)) %>%\n  # Keep only the columns you want in the final output\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n\nExplanation:\n\n• any(type == \"Type_II\") returns TRUE if there is at least one Type_II for a given ID.  \n• has_two_Type_I_within_90 checks only the Type_I dates. After sorting, diff(typeI_dates) produces the consecutive date differences. We then check whether any of these differences is ≤ 90 days.  \n• Finally, we unify those two conditions with OR (|) and cast to integer to get a 0/1 flag.",

Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_two_TypeI_90d = {\n      typeI_dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      length(typeI_dates) >= 2 && (max(typeI_dates) - min(typeI_dates)) >= 90\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_typeII | has_two_TypeI_90d)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nThere's a critical issue with the second criterion. The task asks for \"Two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\" The submitted solution checks if there are at least two Type_I records AND if the time span between the earliest and latest Type_I visit is at least 90 days.\n\nHowever, this misinterprets the requirement. The criterion actually means we need to find pairs of Type_I records where the dates are within 90 days of each other, not separated by at least 90 days. \n\nTherefore, the condition `(max(typeI_dates) - min(typeI_dates)) >= 90` is incorrect. It should be checking if there are any pairs of dates less than or equal to 90 days apart, similar to what's shown in the criterion's example solutions: `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`.\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirement that would lead to incorrect results.\n\nGRADE: I",

The key idea is to group by ID and compute two logical conditions:\n\n• \"has_typeII\": does the ID have at least one Type_II record?  \n• \"has_two_TypeI_90d\": does the ID have two or more Type_I records that are at least 90 days apart?\n\nThen the final Flag can simply be the logical OR of those two conditions.  For brevity, I show a dplyr pipeline below:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_two_TypeI_90d = {\n      typeI_dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      length(typeI_dates) >= 2 && (max(typeI_dates) - min(typeI_dates)) >= 90\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_typeII | has_two_TypeI_90d)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. group_by(ID) splits the data by ID.  \n2. any(type == \"Type_II\") checks if there is at least one Type_II in that ID’s rows.  \n3. Sorting the Type_I dates (typeI_dates) and comparing max and min shows if the earliest and latest Type_I visits are 90 or more days apart (provided at least two Type_I visits exist).  \n4. Finally, Flag is just the OR of those logical conditions converted to integer (0/1).\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The task asks for \"Two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\" The submitted solution checks if there are at least two Type_I records AND if the time span between the earliest and latest Type_I visit is at least 90 days.\n\nHowever, this misinterprets the requirement. The criterion actually means we need to find pairs of Type_I records where the dates are within 90 days of each other, not separated by at least 90 days. \n\nTherefore, the condition `(max(typeI_dates) - min(typeI_dates)) >= 90` is incorrect. It should be checking if there are any pairs of dates less than or equal to 90 days apart, similar to what's shown in the criterion's example solutions: `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`.\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirement that would lead to incorrect results.\n\nGRADE: I"

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Below is one possible tidyverse‐based approach:\n\n1. Group by the plane’s tail number so we can look at flights for the same aircraft over time.  \n2. Sort each group by the actual departure time (or date + scheduled departure time, etc.) so flights are in the proper chronological order.  \n3. Use lag() on dep_delay to find the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight.  \n4. For each unique previous departure delay, compute the mean departure delay of the current flight.  \n5. Plot those two quantities.\n\nExample code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# 1. Group by plane, 2. sort chronologically, 3. capture lagged departure delay\nflights_lag <- flights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# 4. For each previous delay, compute mean of current delay\n# 5. Plot (x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)\nflights_lag %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Current Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean Current Flight Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nThis generates a scatterplot of “mean current flight delay” (y‐axis) versus the “immediately previous flight delay” (x‐axis).\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Below is one straightforward approach. The main idea is:\n\n1. Sort flights chronologically (year, month, day, dep_time).  \n2. Use dplyr’s mutate() with lag(dep_delay) to record the previous flight’s departure delay in a new column (e.g., lag_dep_delay).  \n3. Group by lag_dep_delay and compute the mean departure delay for the current flight.  \n4. Plot x = lag_dep_delay, y = mean(dep_delay).\n\nExample code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # 1. Order chronologically\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>% \n  # 2. Record the departure delay of the previous flight\n  mutate(lag_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # 3. Group by previous flight's delay and compute mean delay of current flight\n  group_by(lag_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # 4. Plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = lag_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Current Flight\"\n  )\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "Looking at the submitted answer, I need to check if it addresses the missing `req_method(\"GET\")` criterion.\n\nThe original code in the task uses a curl command with `-X 'GET'` but then provides a JSON payload in the body with the `-d` flag. In the httr2 R code, there is no explicit method specified.\n\nThe submitted answer recognizes the problem - that a GET request with a JSON body is causing the 405 error. The answer actually recommends changing to POST (not GET) with:\n\n```r\nreq_method(\"POST\")\n```\n\nThis is explicitly included in the solution code. The answer doesn't maintain the GET method because the diagnosis is that using GET with a request body is the cause of the error.\n\nSo while the submission doesn't include `req_method(\"GET\")`, it's intentionally using `req_method(\"POST\")` instead as part of the solution. The criterion appears to be asking if the missing method is addressed, which it is, though with POST rather than GET.\n\nSince the solution correctly identifies the problem (mixing GET with a request body) and provides a proper fix by changing the method to POST and explicitly including the req_method() call, it meets the criterion of addressing the missing method specification.\n\nGRADE: C",

The answer actually recommends changing to POST (not GET) with:\n\n```r\nreq_method(\"POST\")\n```\n\nThis is explicitly included in the solution code. The answer doesn't maintain the GET method because the diagnosis is that using GET with a request body is the cause of the error.\n\nSo while the submission doesn't include `req_method(\"GET\")`, it's intentionally using `req_method(\"POST\")` instead as part of the solution. The criterion appears to be asking if the missing method is addressed, which it is, though with POST rather than GET.\n\nSince the solution correctly identifies the problem (mixing GET with a request body) and provides a proper fix by changing the method to POST and explicitly including the req_method() call, it meets the criterion of addressing the missing method specification.\n\nGRADE: C"

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: One simple way is to “override” the legend aesthetics for all legend entries, including the unused level “d.” For instance, you can force the legend entries to use a specific shape (e.g., a filled circle) by adding something like:\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(a = \"red\",\n               b = \"blue\",\n               c = \"yellow\",\n               d = \"green\"),\n    drop = FALSE\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16)))\n\nSince there are no actual points in the data for “d,” ggplot by default doesn’t draw a symbol for it. Specifying override.aes in guide_legend ensures that every legend entry (including “d”) displays a green circle instead of a blank symbol.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: A convenient way to force a legend key (the “dot”) for the unused level is to tell ggplot explicitly how to draw the legend items, even when no points of a particular level appear in the data. One straightforward solution is to use guide_legend(override.aes = ...). For example:\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\"),\n    drop = FALSE,\n    # Explicitly override any legend aesthetics so \"d\" is drawn\n    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16))\n  )\n\nBecause drop = FALSE tells ggplot to keep the “d” level in the legend, and override.aes = list(shape = 16) ensures we actually get a dot for “d” (as well as for the other levels). By default, ggplot does not draw a key for levels with zero data points. The override.aes argument in guide_legend() forces a key to be drawn regardless.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

For example, you can bind in a row with NA coordinates but z = \"d\":\n\ndf2 <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n\nThe na.rm = TRUE ensures the NA coordinates do not produce an error, and ggplot will include the color for “d” in the legend (with its green dot).\n\nAlternatively, you can use override.aes in guide_legend and drop = FALSE on the scale, which tells ggplot to include the unused levels and forces a legend key to be drawn:\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\"),\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    guide  = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 19))\n  )\n\nHere, override.aes = list(shape = 19) instructs ggplot to draw a point symbol even though “d” does not appear in the data.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission correctly identifies that special characters in the address need to be encoded for the URL to be valid, which aligns perfectly with the criterion's requirements.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submission properly implements the requested changes according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion suggests making two key changes:\n1. Adding `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` instead of just `scale$get_breaks()` when handling discrete scales\n2. Preserving names in the second case by using `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of making these direct changes, it adds a complex code block that:\n- Adds logic to check if primary breaks have names\n- Creates a function to map the breaks to their names\n- Only applies this when labels are derived\n\nWhile the submission does try to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the specific code changes requested in the criterion. The criterion indicates a much simpler solution with just two small modifications to preserve names of breaks during the mapping process.\n\nThe submission's approach might work functionally, but it doesn't match the specific implementation suggested by the criterion, which focuses on preserving names during the mapping of breaks rather than handling it at the labels level.\n\nGRADE: I",

Instead of making these direct changes, it adds a complex code block that:\n- Adds logic to check if primary breaks have names\n- Creates a function to map the breaks to their names\n- Only applies this when labels are derived\n\nWhile the submission does try to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the specific code changes requested in the criterion. The criterion indicates a much simpler solution with just two small modifications to preserve names of breaks during the mapping process.\n\nThe submission's approach might work functionally, but it doesn't match the specific implementation suggested by the criterion, which focuses on preserving names during the mapping of breaks rather than handling it at the labels level.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submitted answer matches the criterion for correctly implementing named discrete breaks as labels in the secondary axis functionality.\n\nThe criterion specifies two changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of modifying how breaks are retrieved and mapped to preserve names, it adds a new block of code that explicitly checks if:\n- The scale is discrete\n- Labels are waiver() (default)\n- Breaks have names\n\nIf these conditions are met, it sets the labels to be the names of the breaks.\n\nWhile this approach might achieve similar functionality, it does not implement the specific changes required in the criterion. The submission's approach handles named breaks at a later stage rather than ensuring names are preserved during initial retrieval and mapping.\n\nThe criterion specifically requires modifying how breaks are handled to preserve names throughout the process, not adding a separate check to use names as labels after the fact.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for handling named discrete breaks in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two necessary changes:\n1. In the `init` function, modify `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. In the `break_info` function, modify `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names during the break calculation process, it adds code to the `init` function that checks if breaks have names, and if so, assigns those names to `self$labels`. This approach attempts to address the stated goal (using names of discrete breaks as labels), but it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission's approach might work in some cases, but it doesn't follow the specified solution path. The criterion specifically requires changes to how break names are preserved during the mapping process, while the submission focuses on extracting names to use as labels after the fact.\n\nGRADE: I",

It simply groups by tailnum, computes the fraction of NA values in arr_delay, and then filters to tailnums with at least 100 flights, picking the one with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_prop = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_prop)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Groups by tailnum\n2. Summarizes to get total_flights (using n()) and na_prop (using mean(is.na(arr_delay)))\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranges in descending order of na_prop\n5. Takes the first row with slice(1)\n\nThe criterion describes a different workflow:\n1. First filter to keep only tailnums with > 100 flights (using grouped filter)\n2. Then summarize to get the mean of is.na(arr_delay)\n3. Arrange in descending order\n\nThe key difference is that the submission does the filtering AFTER summarization, while the criterion expects filtering BEFORE summarization. \n\nHowever, the mathematical result should be the same. The submission correctly:\n- Uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)) to calculate the proportion of NAs (not the incorrect approaches mentioned in the criterion)\n- Filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- Arranges in descending order to find the highest proportion\n- Uses the correct column (arr_delay)\n- Ignores the planes data\n\nThe submission accomplishes the requested task and produces the correct answer, even though the workflow is different from what's described in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

The solution differs from the criterion's approach. Instead of filtering grouped data first (keeping only tailnums with >100 flights), this solution first summarizes all tailnums and then filters the summarized data.\n\n2. The solution correctly calculates the proportion of NA arr_delay values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`.\n\n3. The solution correctly arranges the results in descending order of the proportion of NAs.\n\n4. The solution adds a `slice(1)` to return only the top result, which was not specified in the criterion but is reasonable given the task description.\n\nWhile the approach is different from the one outlined in the criterion, the submitted solution will yield the correct result. The criterion's approach is more efficient (filtering first reduces the data before summarization), but the submitted approach is logically sound and will produce the correct answer.\n\nGRADE: C",

Essentially, you group by tailnum, compute the total flights and the proportion of NA arr_delay for each tailnum, filter to those with at least 100 flights, then pick the one with the highest NA proportion:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The solution differs from the criterion's approach. Instead of filtering grouped data first (keeping only tailnums with >100 flights), this solution first summarizes all tailnums and then filters the summarized data.\n\n2. The solution correctly calculates the proportion of NA arr_delay values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`.\n\n3. The solution correctly arranges the results in descending order of the proportion of NAs.\n\n4. The solution adds a `slice(1)` to return only the top result, which was not specified in the criterion but is reasonable given the task description.\n\nWhile the approach is different from the one outlined in the criterion, the submitted solution will yield the correct result. The criterion's approach is more efficient (filtering first reduces the data before summarization), but the submitted approach is logically sound and will produce the correct answer.\n\nGRADE: C"

A grouping by tailnum\n2. Calculating the number of flights per tailnum with `n()` and the proportion of NA arr_delays using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` - this is the correct approach as specified in the criterion\n3. Filtering to only include tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranging in descending order of the proportion with NA arr_delays\n5. Taking the first row to get the tailnum with the highest proportion\n\nHowever, the approach is slightly different from the one specified in the criterion. The criterion suggests first filtering to tailnums with more than 100 flights, then summarizing. The submitted solution first summarizes (calculating total flights and proportion of NAs), then filters.\n\nWhile the approaches differ in their order of operations, both will produce the correct result for this problem. The solution correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of missing values, which was a key point in the criterion.\n\nAlso, the submitted solution uses `slice(1)` to get the top result, which is a valid alternative to just viewing the first row from the arranged data.\n\nGRADE: C",

The key steps are:\n\n• Group by tailnum.  \n• Count the total number of flights (n()).  \n• Compute the fraction of flights with NA for arr_delay (mean(is.na(arr_delay))).  \n• Filter to only those tailnums with at least 100 flights.  \n• Arrange in descending order of that fraction and pick the first row.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

A grouping by tailnum\n2. Calculating the number of flights per tailnum with `n()` and the proportion of NA arr_delays using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` - this is the correct approach as specified in the criterion\n3. Filtering to only include tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranging in descending order of the proportion with NA arr_delays\n5. Taking the first row to get the tailnum with the highest proportion\n\nHowever, the approach is slightly different from the one specified in the criterion. The criterion suggests first filtering to tailnums with more than 100 flights, then summarizing. The submitted solution first summarizes (calculating total flights and proportion of NAs), then filters.\n\nWhile the approaches differ in their order of operations, both will produce the correct result for this problem. The solution correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of missing values, which was a key point in the criterion.\n\nAlso, the submitted solution uses `slice(1)` to get the top result, which is a valid alternative to just viewing the first row from the arranged data.\n\nGRADE: C"

For example:\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = your_x_variable, y = your_y_variable)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)\n\nThis way, the points are jittered horizontally by up to 0.2 units on the x‑axis, but the y values remain unchanged.\n***\n[Criterion]: Either set `geom_jitter(height = 0)` or `geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

For example:\n\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input  = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\n# This will yield name == \"simple_addition\"\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n\nHowever, if you call task_create like this:\n\ntask_create(dataset = tibble(input = ..., target = ...))\n\nthen R sees the entire tibble(...) expression instead of a simple symbol, and deparse(substitute(dataset)) reflects that. The fix is to assign the tibble to a variable in advance (as in the simple_addition example) rather than creating it inline, if you want the default name to match the symbol.",

Within a moduleServer call, Shiny provides session$ns as the correct namespacing function. So rather than\n\nns <- NS(id)\n\nuse\n\nns <- session$ns\n\nIn other words, your innerServer function should look like:\n\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # <--- use the module’s own namespace\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x = t.x, y = t.y)\n      ggplot(data = t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nThat change ensures the verbatimTextOutput and plotOutput get correctly bound to the outputs you defined in the module server.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

That should solve the “Can’t find package called spatialstuff” error.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

For example:\n\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo from Parent\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      cat(\"Calling Parent foo:\\n\")\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo() \n#> Calling Parent foo:\n#> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n\nDefining public methods directly in the class body (rather than dynamically creating them inside initialize()) avoids the locked-binding error and lets you cleanly override them in subclasses.",

By assigning self[[\"foo\"]] inside initialize() for the parent, you end up locking “foo” and then re-defining it in the child triggers the “locked binding” error.\n\nA straightforward fix is simply to define foo as a normal method in the parent’s public list instead of creating it in initialize(). For example:\n\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo from Parent\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      cat(\"foo from Child\\n\")\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> foo from Child\n#> foo from Parent\n\nBecause “foo” is no longer defined inside initialize(), it is not locked at instantiation time, so you can safely override it in the child class.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This allows Shiny to properly access and manage these objects.\n\nWhile the criterion provides a slightly different implementation (directly using `input$condition` instead of creating separate reactive expressions for each input), the submission's approach with separate reactive expressions is equally valid in Shiny and would fix the error.\n\nBoth solutions accomplish the same goal - moving the code inside the server function so Shiny can properly manage the reactive context.

This allows Shiny to properly access and manage these objects.\n\nWhile the criterion provides a slightly different implementation (directly using `input$condition` instead of creating separate reactive expressions for each input), the submission's approach with separate reactive expressions is equally valid in Shiny and would fix the error.\n\nBoth solutions accomplish the same goal - moving the code inside the server function so Shiny can properly manage the reactive context. The submission includes all necessary components and would successfully fix the error described in the task.\n\nGRADE: C"

The simplest fix is to move all of the reactive logic (ckd_condition, visit_threshold, filtered_data) and the renderPlot call for output$plot into the server function.

For example:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  \n  # Read and preprocess your data once here (global data can also be read outside server if it does not depend on input)\n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n    as.data.frame() %>%\n    mutate(CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\"))\n  \n  # Reactive expression to filter data\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)    # Ensure inputs exist\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create your plot\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    # Validate user inputs\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\nKey points:\n• Anything that references input or output must be inside server.  \n• The filtered_data reactive must call input$condition and input$visit_threshold rather than the old ckd_condition() / visit_threshold() variables if they are not defined separately.  \n• If you do define them separately, do it inside server and remember to use parentheses (e.g. ckd_condition()).  \n• Lastly, return an actual plot from renderPlot.  \n\nBy restructuring the code into a proper server function, Shiny knows how to set up your inputs and outputs, and the error \"Can't read output 'plot'\" will go away.",

For example:\n\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  \n  # Use [[ to avoid partial matching\n  out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n\nUsing out[[\"refresh_token\"]] ensures that R performs an exact-match lookup for \"refresh_token\" rather than a partial match that can be confused by fields like refresh_token_expires_in.\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`.

Because it’s not an exported function, you cannot call it as dplyr::closest() (nor can you just @importFrom it). If your own code indirectly “finds” closest() because of how your package is attached or because of dplyr’s internal namespaces, that might appear to work locally, but it will raise warnings, cause lint errors, and may break in the future.\n\nIn other words, to fix your package so that it passes R CMD check (and linters), you should not rely on an unexported dplyr function. Typically, you would:\n\n• Replace it with a public (exported) function that does the same thing,  \n• Or copy the relevant logic (rewriting, renaming, etc.) into your own package under a new function name,  \n• Or find another package that provides the functionality you need, and import that instead.\n\nIf you really must call an unexported function (discouraged on CRAN), you could theoretically use dplyr:::closest(), but that is almost certain to fail CRAN checks and is still subject to breakage if dplyr changes its internal API.  \n\nHence, the recommended solution is to either find a suitable exported alternative in dplyr (or another package) or implement your own closest() function rather than relying on dplyr’s internal code.",
