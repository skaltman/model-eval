To make the **height of each bar represent the proportion** of diamonds with a given cut (rather than the count), you need to:\n\n- Use `geom_bar()`'s `position = \"fill\"` argument, which **stacks** by a variable (here, clarity) **so each bar is filled according to that variable and all bars are scaled to the same height: 1**. This makes each bar represent proportions within that `cut`.\n\nHowever, to **make the bar *height* proportional to the *proportion* of diamonds in each cut category** (i.e., across all diamonds), you need to compute proportions yourself. This requires pre-summarizing the data.\n\nHere are the **two approaches**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. If you want *within-cut* proportions for clarity (standard stacked bar, bars all same height):\n\n```r\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\")\n```\n- **Here each bar is the same height (1), and the segments show the proportion of `clarity` within each `cut`.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. If you want **bar height to show the overall proportion of observations in each cut** (bar height matches cut frequency as a proportion of all diamonds), you need to pre-summarise:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndiamonds_prop <- diamonds %>%\n  count(cut, clarity) %>%\n  group_by(cut) %>%\n  mutate(cut_total = sum(n)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) # proportion of all diamonds\n\nggplot(diamonds_prop, aes(x = cut, y = prop, fill = clarity)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n- **Now, bar height is proportional to the share of all diamonds in each `cut`, and bars are filled by `clarity` proportions within `cut`.**\n\nYou can also omit the `group_by(cut)` line and just `prop = n / sum(diamonds$n)` if you want the segment heights to be the proportion of all diamonds.\n\n---\n\n#### TL;DR\n\n- For *within-cut* proportions: `geom_bar(position=\"fill\")`\n- For *overall* cut proportions: use `stat=\"identity\"` with a summarized data frame\n\n**Your request is for the second case**: use the `dplyr` approach (`geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")`) above."

The code checks if any dates are at least 90 days apart, but the problem asks for \"Type_I\" cases within at least 90 days of one another (meaning the difference should be ≤ 90 days, not ≥ 90 days).\n\nThe criterion provides two correct solutions:\n1. Using `|` (OR) instead of `&` (AND)\n2. Using `<=` for the 90-day comparison, not `>=`\n\nThe submission's core logic is therefore incorrect, making it inconsistent with the criterion's solution.\n\nGRADE: I"

At least two `Type_I` visits at least 90 days apart\n\n- **Select Type_I rows**\n- **For each ID**: take all Type_I visit dates, check if any pair is >= 90 days apart.\n\n---\n\nLet's implement this in steps using tidyverse (`dplyr` + `tidyr`):\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# For convenience, ensure columns are as expected\ndf <- df %>% mutate(ID = as.character(ID), type = as.character(type), date = as.Date(date))\n\n# 1.

Merge and compute final flag\nresult <- typeII_present %>%\n  left_join(typeI_dates, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(flag_typeII & date_pairs_at_least90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nresult\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Result**\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Explanation/notes**\n\n- For step 2:  \n    - For each ID with at least 2 `Type_I` dates, we check **all pairs** and flag TRUE if any are >= 90 days apart.\n\n- Step 3 combines the two criteria, with Flag only turning on if **both** are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n## **One-step tidy option**\n\nHere’s a fully piped solution:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    flag_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    typeI_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    n_typeI = sum(type == \"Type_I\"),\n    date_pairs_at_least90 = {\n      dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      if(length(dates) >= 2) {\n        any(outer(dates, dates, function(x, y) abs(as.numeric(x - y))) >= 90)\n      } else {\n        FALSE\n      }\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(flag_typeII & date_pairs_at_least90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help adjusting for edge cases or want this as a function!",

Check for >=2 Type_I visits >=90 days apart per ID\ntypeI_dates <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_typeI = n(),\n    # Only IDs with 2 or more Type_I visits can possibly qualify\n    date_pairs_at_least90 = if(n_typeI >= 2) {\n      dates <- sort(date)\n      # Compute all unique pairs\n      any(outer(dates, dates, function(x, y) abs(as.numeric(x - y))) >= 90)\n    } else {\n      FALSE\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# 3. Merge and compute final flag\nresult <- typeII_present %>%\n  left_join(typeI_dates, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(flag_typeII & date_pairs_at_least90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nresult\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Result**\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Explanation/notes**\n\n- For step 2:  \n    - For each ID with at least 2 `Type_I` dates, we check **all pairs** and flag TRUE if any are >= 90 days apart.\n\n- Step 3 combines the two criteria, with Flag only turning on if **both** are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n## **One-step tidy option**\n\nHere’s a fully piped solution:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    flag_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    typeI_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    n_typeI = sum(type == \"Type_I\"),\n    date_pairs_at_least90 = {\n      dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      if(length(dates) >= 2) {\n        any(outer(dates, dates, function(x, y) abs(as.numeric(x - y))) >= 90)\n      } else {\n        FALSE\n      }\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(flag_typeII & date_pairs_at_least90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help adjusting for edge cases or want this as a function!",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for setting a conditional boolean flag based on the specified criteria.\n\nLet's analyze the submission against the two required conditions:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submission's approach:\n- It correctly checks for the presence of \"Type_II\" using `has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- For the \"Type_I\" condition, it calculates the maximum difference between all \"Type_I\" dates, and checks if this difference is ≥ 90 days\n\nHowever, there's a critical misinterpretation in the second condition. The task requires finding two \"Type_I\" occurrences that are \"within at least 90 days of one another,\" which means the difference should be ≤ 90 days, not ≥ 90 days. The submission is checking for Type_I records that are at least 90 days apart, which is the opposite of the requirement.\n\nThe correct solution in the criterion checks this with `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`, which looks for any pair of dates with a difference less than or equal to 90 days.\n\nAdditionally, the submission uses a logical AND (`&`) between the two conditions, meaning both conditions need to be satisfied. However, the task description uses \"based on the criteria:\" followed by two bullet points, which could be interpreted as needing both conditions or either condition. The criterion solution uses a logical OR (`|`), which means either condition would set the flag.\n\nDue to these misinterpretations of the core requirements, the submission produces incorrect results.\n\nGRADE: I",

Here’s one tidyverse approach to your problem.\n\n## **Step-by-step Plan**\nFor each `ID`:\n1. **Check condition 1**: Is there at least one `\"Type_II\"`?\n2. **Check condition 2**: Are there at least two `\"Type_I\"` visits that occur at least 90 days apart?\n3. Create a **Flag**: **1** if both conditions true, else **0**.\n\n---\n\n## **The Code**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    max_type_I_diff = {\n      dates_I <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      if(length(dates_I) >= 2) {\n        as.numeric(max(dates_I) - min(dates_I))\n      } else {\n        0\n      }\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II & max_type_I_diff >= 90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation**\n- For each `ID`, we check for the presence of `\"Type_II\"`.\n- For `\"Type_I\"`, we find all relevant dates and compute the difference between the earliest and latest (thus, the maximal possible pairwise difference).\n  - This is sufficient: if the maximal span is ≥90 days, then there exists at least one pair ≥90 apart.\n- The flag is set if both these are true.\n\n---\n\n## **Result**\n\n```r\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Let me know if you need the solution to consider every pair of dates (a less efficient alternative), or if you’d like this as a column in the original `df`.**\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submission's approach:\n- It correctly checks for the presence of \"Type_II\" using `has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- For the \"Type_I\" condition, it calculates the maximum difference between all \"Type_I\" dates, and checks if this difference is ≥ 90 days\n\nHowever, there's a critical misinterpretation in the second condition. The task requires finding two \"Type_I\" occurrences that are \"within at least 90 days of one another,\" which means the difference should be ≤ 90 days, not ≥ 90 days. The submission is checking for Type_I records that are at least 90 days apart, which is the opposite of the requirement.\n\nThe correct solution in the criterion checks this with `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`, which looks for any pair of dates with a difference less than or equal to 90 days.\n\nAdditionally, the submission uses a logical AND (`&`) between the two conditions, meaning both conditions need to be satisfied. However, the task description uses \"based on the criteria:\" followed by two bullet points, which could be interpreted as needing both conditions or either condition. The criterion solution uses a logical OR (`|`), which means either condition would set the flag.\n\nDue to these misinterpretations of the core requirements, the submission produces incorrect results.\n\nGRADE: I"

This is a classic use case for `dplyr::lag()`. \n\nThe key is: For each \"chain\" of flights where delays might propagate (e.g., per airport per day), you want—for each flight—to compare its dep_delay with that of the immediately preceding flight. Assuming the **order of rows is not important** (we'll arrange them), and that \"chain\" is \"all flights from the same origin each day\" (probably the clearest for this analysis):\n\n### Code\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%  # ensures correct sequence\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Filter out NA (the first flight in each group has no lagged delay)\nflights_plot <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\n# Now plot: mean dep_delay for each value (or binned value) of dep_delay_lag\n# We'll use bins to smooth it out\n\nflights_plot %>%\n  mutate(\n    dep_delay_lag_bin = cut(dep_delay_lag, breaks = seq(-30, 300, by = 10)) # you can adjust bins\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(dep_delay_lag_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), \n            bin_center = mean(as.numeric(as.character(sub(\"\\\\((.+),.*\", \"\\\\1\", dep_delay_lag_bin)))) ) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay_lag_bin)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = bin_center, y = mean_delay)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes; binned)\",\n        y = \"Mean departure delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n        title = \"Propagation of Departure Delays\"\n    )\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We arrange the data so that each flight is in temporal order per airport per day.\n- We use `mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay))` to get the preceding flight's delay.\n- We group by origin/day (chains of possible influence).\n- To get a smoother trend, we bin the previous flight's delay and calculate the **mean dep_delay** per bin.\n- We plot mean current delay (y) vs. previous flight's delay (x), with a smoothed trend overlay.\n\n### Try it!\nYou can adjust bin widths or use `geom_hex()` or `geom_bin2d()` if you prefer a 2D density heatmap.\n\nThis plot should show a positive trend: the more delayed the previous flight, the more delayed the current one.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

This is a classic *autocorrelation* (lag correlation) problem. You want to plot **mean departure delay** (`dep_delay`) of a flight (Y axis) against the departure delay of the **immediately preceding flight** (X axis), across all flights.\n\nHere's how you can do it with `tidyverse` in R:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%             # sort chronologically\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%         # previous flight's delay\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Dep. Delay vs Previous Flight's Delay\",\n      x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Departure delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- `arrange()` sorts the data in true departure order.\n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` adds a column for each row's previous departure delay.\n- `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))` removes first row and any NAs.\n- `geom_point(alpha = 0.05)` plots the raw points, with strong transparency to reduce overplotting.\n- `geom_smooth()` overlays a trend line to show how mean delay changes with previous delay.\n\nThis will visualize the **relationship between a flight's departure delay and that of the immediately preceding flight**. You should see a positive trend – if the previous flight was delayed, the next one tends to be as well.\n\nIf you're interested in **average** delay for each value/range of prev delay, you can bin:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 500, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight's Departure Delay (Binned)\",\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (bin, min)\",\n      y = \"Mean Departure Delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\nLet me know if you want this for **within each carrier**, or **by day/airport**, etc!\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

                      "text": "Great question! This is a classic *autocorrelation* (lag correlation) problem. You want to plot **mean departure delay** (`dep_delay`) of a flight (Y axis) against the departure delay of the **immediately preceding flight** (X axis), across all flights.\n\nHere's how you can do it with `tidyverse` in R:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%             # sort chronologically\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%         # previous flight's delay\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Dep. Delay vs Previous Flight's Delay\",\n      x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Departure delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- `arrange()` sorts the data in true departure order.\n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` adds a column for each row's previous departure delay.\n- `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))` removes first row and any NAs.\n- `geom_point(alpha = 0.05)` plots the raw points, with strong transparency to reduce overplotting.\n- `geom_smooth()` overlays a trend line to show how mean delay changes with previous delay.\n\nThis will visualize the **relationship between a flight's departure delay and that of the immediately preceding flight**. You should see a positive trend – if the previous flight was delayed, the next one tends to be as well.\n\nIf you're interested in **average** delay for each value/range of prev delay, you can bin:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 500, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight's Departure Delay (Binned)\",\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (bin, min)\",\n      y = \"Mean Departure Delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\nLet me know if you want this for **within each carrier**, or **by day/airport**, etc!"

                  "text": "Great question! This is a classic *autocorrelation* (lag correlation) problem. You want to plot **mean departure delay** (`dep_delay`) of a flight (Y axis) against the departure delay of the **immediately preceding flight** (X axis), across all flights.\n\nHere's how you can do it with `tidyverse` in R:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%             # sort chronologically\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%         # previous flight's delay\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Dep. Delay vs Previous Flight's Delay\",\n      x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Departure delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- `arrange()` sorts the data in true departure order.\n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` adds a column for each row's previous departure delay.\n- `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))` removes first row and any NAs.\n- `geom_point(alpha = 0.05)` plots the raw points, with strong transparency to reduce overplotting.\n- `geom_smooth()` overlays a trend line to show how mean delay changes with previous delay.\n\nThis will visualize the **relationship between a flight's departure delay and that of the immediately preceding flight**. You should see a positive trend – if the previous flight was delayed, the next one tends to be as well.\n\nIf you're interested in **average** delay for each value/range of prev delay, you can bin:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 500, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight's Departure Delay (Binned)\",\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (bin, min)\",\n      y = \"Mean Departure Delay (min)\"\n    )\n```\n\nLet me know if you want this for **within each carrier**, or **by day/airport**, etc!",

          "explanation": "I'll assess the submitted answer against the criterion.\n\nThe submission shows knowledge of using `lag()` to get the previous flight's delay, which is essential for this task. However, there are two key issues:\n\n1. **Missing grouping by origin**: The primary submission arranges flights by time globally, not by airport origin. This means it's looking at the previous flight regardless of airport, which doesn't match the criterion that specifically states \"the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport.\" The submission does mention grouping by origin as an alternative approach in the explanation, but it's not part of the main solution.\n\n2. **Missing calculation of mean departure delay**: The criterion specifies visualizing the *mean* departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay. The submission simply plots all points without calculating means. It shows raw delay values on both axes rather than calculating mean delay for each lagged delay value.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `lag()` to create the lagged variable\n- Handles NAs appropriately\n- Creates a visualization with appropriate labels\n- Mentions grouping by origin (but as an optional alternative)\n\nHowever, it misses the core requirement of calculating means by lagged delay values, and the primary solution doesn't group by origin as required.\n\nGRADE: P",

Here’s how you can visualize the correlation of each flight’s `dep_delay` with the **previous** flight’s `dep_delay` using **tidyverse**, particularly the `lag()` function from dplyr.\n\nWe'll do it **by group** (e.g., for each origin airport), but for simplicity, let's do it for all flights in time order. If you want to do it for each origin (which makes more sense), just group by `origin` as well.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, flight) %>%         # Order by actual departure time\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%             # Get previous dep_delay\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%   # Ensure no missing data\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_bin2d(bins = 100) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous flight's departure delay (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Current flight's departure delay (minutes)\",\n      title = \"Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**Explanations:**\n- `arrange` makes sure flights are in time order.\n- `lag(dep_delay)` grabs the previous flight’s delay for each row.\n- `geom_bin2d` (or you can use `geom_point(alpha = 0.05)` if you want points, but with 330k+ records, bins work better).\n- If you'd like to group by `origin`, do:\n\n  ```r\n  flights %>%\n    group_by(origin) %>%\n    arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n    mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n    ungroup() %>%\n    filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n      geom_bin2d(bins = 100) +\n      scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n      facet_wrap(~origin) +\n      theme_minimal()\n  ```\n\n> This visualization will show the temporal correlation of delays between sequential flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

However, there are two key issues:\n\n1. **Missing grouping by origin**: The primary submission arranges flights by time globally, not by airport origin. This means it's looking at the previous flight regardless of airport, which doesn't match the criterion that specifically states \"the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport.\" The submission does mention grouping by origin as an alternative approach in the explanation, but it's not part of the main solution.\n\n2. **Missing calculation of mean departure delay**: The criterion specifies visualizing the *mean* departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay. The submission simply plots all points without calculating means. It shows raw delay values on both axes rather than calculating mean delay for each lagged delay value.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `lag()` to create the lagged variable\n- Handles NAs appropriately\n- Creates a visualization with appropriate labels\n- Mentions grouping by origin (but as an optional alternative)\n\nHowever, it misses the core requirement of calculating means by lagged delay values, and the primary solution doesn't group by origin as required.\n\nGRADE: P"

HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed\n\nHow do I fix it?\n***\n[Submission]: Let's break down your issue!\n\n## **What's Wrong?**\n\n### 1. **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed**\n\nThis error **almost always means: \"You can't use this method (like GET, POST, PUT, etc.) on this endpoint.\"**  \nYour cURL is using **`-X 'GET'`** _with a request body_ (with `-d`), and your R/httr2 is doing the same by setting a body on a GET request.\n\n### 2. **GET requests should _not_ have a body**\n\nThe [HTTP spec](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/978061/http-get-with-request-body) doesn't prohibit GET bodies but **many servers don't support or expect bodies on GET**—they expect parameters in the URL instead.\n\n### 3. **Your endpoint probably expects a POST or similar**\n\nUsually, when you want to send a JSON body, the server wants a `POST` (or sometimes `PUT` or `PATCH`).\n\n---\n\n## **How To Fix**\n\n**Try changing the HTTP verb from `GET` to `POST` both in cURL and R:**\n\n### **In cURL:**\n\nChange:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n```\nto:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n```\n\nSo full command (fixing your placeholder):\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n---\n\n### **In R / httr2:**\n\nAdd **`req_method(\"POST\")`**:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n_(You named your object `one2` but at the end you use `cone2`.

Adjust as needed.)_\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Method | JSON body?       | Typical use     |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| GET    | ❌ (bad idea)    | Get data        |\n| POST   | ✅ (very common) | Send data       |\n| PUT    | ✅               | Update data     |\n\n---\n\n## **In Short**\n\n- **405 error** = method not allowed.  \n- Change both your cURL and R request to use **POST** instead of **GET** when sending a JSON body.  \n- Use **GET** when you only retrieve data, often with parameters in the URL, not in a request body.\n\n---\n\n#### If you **must** use GET and your API expects parameters, try using query arguments like:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET 'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\nOr in httr2:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_url_query(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- **Don't send a JSON body with GET!**  \n- Use POST if that's what the API expects.  \n- Read the API documentation if unsure.",

When you use `drop = FALSE` in your scale, it will **add the unused levels** to the legend, but for discrete scales, there are no data points for those levels, so the legend keys are empty (no dots).\n\n## **Why does this happen?**\n`ggplot2` draws the legend key for each level according to the geoms present in the plot for those levels. If there are _no points_ in the data mapped to `\"d\"`, it doesn't know to draw a colored dot there — it draws a blank.\n\n---\n\n# **How to show a dot for unused levels?**\n\nThere is no built-in option in `ggplot2` to ask it to always show a solid point for unused discrete legend keys. However, there are **workarounds:**\n\n## **Option 1: Add a fake row with `NA` values to your data**\nYou can add a \"dummy\" row to your data where `\"z\" == \"d\"`, but `x` and `y` are `NA`, so no point is plotted but the legend key is complete.\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for \"d\" with NA coordinates\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=\"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\nThis will show all legend keys (including \"d\") as solid points in the correct color, but will not plot any unwanted points on the actual plot (since `NA` coordinates are ignored for plotting).\n\n---\n\n## **Option 2: Use `override.aes` in `guides()`**\n\nYou can explicitly tell ggplot how to draw the legend:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\nBut this **won't** force a \"d\" point to be shown unless there's data for \"d\".\n\n---\n\n## **Option 3: Explicity map a \"dummy\" series**\nIf you have more geoms, or want to be more explicit, you can add a separate invisible geom for the unused level(s):\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  # Add an invisible point for \"d\" (placed at y = Inf so off-plot), color will still be used in legend\n  geom_point(aes(x = NA, y = NA, color = \"d\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\nSame result: you'll get a solid green dot for \"d\" in the legend.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**  \n**Add a row to your data (with NA for x/y and the unused level for z), or add an invisible geom_point with aes(color = 'd').** This will cause ggplot2's legend to treat the unused value like all the others and generate a solid colored key.\n\n---\n\n## **Example putting it all together:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add dummy for \"d\"\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**This gives you green, blue, red, and yellow colored legend keys, all with filled dots.**"

When you use `drop = FALSE` in your scale, it will **add the unused levels** to the legend, but for discrete scales, there are no data points for those levels, so the legend keys are empty (no dots).\n\n## **Why does this happen?**\n`ggplot2` draws the legend key for each level according to the geoms present in the plot for those levels. If there are _no points_ in the data mapped to `\"d\"`, it doesn't know to draw a colored dot there — it draws a blank.\n\n---\n\n# **How to show a dot for unused levels?**\n\nThere is no built-in option in `ggplot2` to ask it to always show a solid point for unused discrete legend keys. However, there are **workarounds:**\n\n## **Option 1: Add a fake row with `NA` values to your data**\nYou can add a \"dummy\" row to your data where `\"z\" == \"d\"`, but `x` and `y` are `NA`, so no point is plotted but the legend key is complete.\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for \"d\" with NA coordinates\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=\"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\nThis will show all legend keys (including \"d\") as solid points in the correct color, but will not plot any unwanted points on the actual plot (since `NA` coordinates are ignored for plotting).\n\n---\n\n## **Option 2: Use `override.aes` in `guides()`**\n\nYou can explicitly tell ggplot how to draw the legend:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\nBut this **won't** force a \"d\" point to be shown unless there's data for \"d\".\n\n---\n\n## **Option 3: Explicity map a \"dummy\" series**\nIf you have more geoms, or want to be more explicit, you can add a separate invisible geom for the unused level(s):\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  # Add an invisible point for \"d\" (placed at y = Inf so off-plot), color will still be used in legend\n  geom_point(aes(x = NA, y = NA, color = \"d\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\nSame result: you'll get a solid green dot for \"d\" in the legend.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**  \n**Add a row to your data (with NA for x/y and the unused level for z), or add an invisible geom_point with aes(color = 'd').** This will cause ggplot2's legend to treat the unused value like all the others and generate a solid colored key.\n\n---\n\n## **Example putting it all together:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add dummy for \"d\"\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**This gives you green, blue, red, and yellow colored legend keys, all with filled dots.**"

The behavior you’re seeing is **by design**: ggplot2 (as of version 3.x and 2024) *does* show unused factor levels in the legend if you use `drop = FALSE`, but it doesn’t show the usual key glyph (the point shape, or line, or whatever) for those unused levels—just a blank spot with the label and color.\n\n**You want the legend key for 'd' to look the same (green dot) as the others, even though it's unused.**\n\n## Why does this happen?\n\n- ggplot2 draws legend keys for the aesthetics that actually appear in the data. For \"unused\" levels (like 'd' above), there are no data rows, so the default legend key doesn’t get drawn.\n- Instead, you get the text and the color swatch, but the *shape* is the default key’s \"empty\" appearance.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n### 1. Add a (possibly invisible) dummy row (the \"gg trick\")\n\nBy far the **simplest fix** is to add a dummy data row with an `NA` in `x` and `y`, and with `z == \"d\"`. NA values won’t plot, but will trigger the legend drawing to _include the point glyph_ for 'd':\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a dummy row for 'd'\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n**Result:**  \nNow the legend will show four dots, including a green one next to 'd'. The dummy point never appears on the plot (because `NA` coordinates are ignored).\n\n### 2. Use `override.aes` to force legend keys\n\nAlternatively, you can force the legend key appearance using `guide = guide_legend()` with `override.aes`, but you’d need to specify enough aesthetics to make it look like what you want:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n# shape = 16 = solid dot\n```\n> **Note:** However, this will add dots for all legend entries, including those that don't appear in the data, with the correct color but only if you haven't mapped shape elsewhere.\n\nBut the \"dummy NA row\" approach is generally more robust, as it works **no matter what other aesthetics are mapped**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Add a dummy row with NA coordinates and the unused factor:**  \nThis is the standard way in ggplot2 to make unused factors draw a \"regular\" key glyph in the legend.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [Hadley Wickham's comment](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/942#issuecomment-181832471)\n- [SO: How to plot a ggplot2 legend key for a factor level not in the data](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38155284/6901725)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n```r\n# Add dummy NA row for unused level\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\nggplot(df2) + geom_point(aes(x, y, color=z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop=FALSE, values=c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"))\n```\nThis gives the green dot for \"d\" in the legend."

Use `override.aes` to force legend keys\n\nAlternatively, you can force the legend key appearance using `guide = guide_legend()` with `override.aes`, but you’d need to specify enough aesthetics to make it look like what you want:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n# shape = 16 = solid dot\n```\n> **Note:** However, this will add dots for all legend entries, including those that don't appear in the data, with the correct color but only if you haven't mapped shape elsewhere.\n\nBut the \"dummy NA row\" approach is generally more robust, as it works **no matter what other aesthetics are mapped**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Add a dummy row with NA coordinates and the unused factor:**  \nThis is the standard way in ggplot2 to make unused factors draw a \"regular\" key glyph in the legend.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [Hadley Wickham's comment](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/942#issuecomment-181832471)\n- [SO: How to plot a ggplot2 legend key for a factor level not in the data](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38155284/6901725)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n```r\n# Add dummy NA row for unused level\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\nggplot(df2) + geom_point(aes(x, y, color=z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop=FALSE, values=c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"))\n```\nThis gives the green dot for \"d\" in the legend."

                  "text": "Great question! The behavior you’re seeing is **by design**: ggplot2 (as of version 3.x and 2024) *does* show unused factor levels in the legend if you use `drop = FALSE`, but it doesn’t show the usual key glyph (the point shape, or line, or whatever) for those unused levels—just a blank spot with the label and color.\n\n**You want the legend key for 'd' to look the same (green dot) as the others, even though it's unused.**\n\n## Why does this happen?\n\n- ggplot2 draws legend keys for the aesthetics that actually appear in the data. For \"unused\" levels (like 'd' above), there are no data rows, so the default legend key doesn’t get drawn.\n- Instead, you get the text and the color swatch, but the *shape* is the default key’s \"empty\" appearance.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n### 1. Add a (possibly invisible) dummy row (the \"gg trick\")\n\nBy far the **simplest fix** is to add a dummy data row with an `NA` in `x` and `y`, and with `z == \"d\"`. NA values won’t plot, but will trigger the legend drawing to _include the point glyph_ for 'd':\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a dummy row for 'd'\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n**Result:**  \nNow the legend will show four dots, including a green one next to 'd'. The dummy point never appears on the plot (because `NA` coordinates are ignored).\n\n### 2. Use `override.aes` to force legend keys\n\nAlternatively, you can force the legend key appearance using `guide = guide_legend()` with `override.aes`, but you’d need to specify enough aesthetics to make it look like what you want:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n# shape = 16 = solid dot\n```\n> **Note:** However, this will add dots for all legend entries, including those that don't appear in the data, with the correct color but only if you haven't mapped shape elsewhere.\n\nBut the \"dummy NA row\" approach is generally more robust, as it works **no matter what other aesthetics are mapped**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Add a dummy row with NA coordinates and the unused factor:**  \nThis is the standard way in ggplot2 to make unused factors draw a \"regular\" key glyph in the legend.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [Hadley Wickham's comment](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/942#issuecomment-181832471)\n- [SO: How to plot a ggplot2 legend key for a factor level not in the data](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38155284/6901725)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n```r\n# Add dummy NA row for unused level\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\nggplot(df2) + geom_point(aes(x, y, color=z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop=FALSE, values=c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"))\n```\nThis gives the green dot for \"d\" in the legend.",

In **ggplot2**, when you include unused levels (like `\"d\"` in your factor) and use `drop = FALSE` in `scale_*_manual()`, the legend shows the unused level, **but** it draws a blank (unfilled) legend key because that level is not present in your data (no `geom` uses color \"green\").\n\nIf you want all legend items to have dots (even for unused factor levels), you need to **add a dummy point for the unused level**. Here's a practical way to do it:\n\n---\n\n### **Solution: Add a \"dummy\" row to your data**\n\nYou can add a row for the unused level (e.g., `z = \"d\"`) with `NA` for `x` and `y`. Setting `show.legend = FALSE` for your main data ensures only the dummy data drives the legend for \"d\".\n\nHere's a minimal, flexible solution:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Your base data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused level (with NA coords so doesn't appear)\ndf_dummy <- data.frame(\n  x = NA,\n  y = NA,\n  z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(data = df_dummy, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n**How it works:**\n\n- The dummy point doesn't show in the plot (`NA` coordinates + `na.rm = TRUE`) but does force the legend to **render a green dot** for \"d\".\n- The legend keys for ALL levels now look the same.\n\nThis is a general trick for ggplot2 when you want ALL factor levels (even unused) to have a fully styled legend key.

Build the request with query parameters (recommended!):**\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nreq <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key)\n\nresponse <- req_perform(req)\n```\n\nThis way, `httr2` internally encodes everything correctly.  \n**You should always pass query parameters using `req_url_query()` instead of gluing together plain strings for URLs containing dynamic user input.**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Don't** put non-encoded data into URLs directly.  \n**Do**:\n- Manually encode (`URLencode`) *or*  \n- Use `req_url_query()` to let `httr2` handle encoding automatically.\n\n---\n\n**Your fixed code:**\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nreq <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key)\n\nresponse <- req_perform(req)\n```\n\n---",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly implements the changes specified in the criterion.\n\nThe criterion requires two specific changes:\n1. In the `if (scale$is_discrete())` block, replacing `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` with `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. In the `else` block related to scale mapping, replacing `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` with `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, I see that the proposed solution takes a different approach. Instead of using `setNames()` as specified in the criterion, the submission:\n1. Gets the breaks and stores them in a variable first\n2. Adds conditional logic to check if breaks have names and then assigns those names to labels\n\nWhile the submission might accomplish a similar goal (using named breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific code changes required by the criterion. The criterion's approach is more direct, preserving names during the assignment of breaks rather than adding additional name-checking logic.\n\nThe submitted solution also doesn't address the second required change about setting names during scale mapping.\n\nGRADE: I",

In the `else` block related to scale mapping, replacing `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` with `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, I see that the proposed solution takes a different approach. Instead of using `setNames()` as specified in the criterion, the submission:\n1. Gets the breaks and stores them in a variable first\n2. Adds conditional logic to check if breaks have names and then assigns those names to labels\n\nWhile the submission might accomplish a similar goal (using named breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific code changes required by the criterion. The criterion's approach is more direct, preserving names during the assignment of breaks rather than adding additional name-checking logic.\n\nThe submitted solution also doesn't address the second required change about setting names during scale mapping.\n\nGRADE: I"

By default, **ggplot2**'s secondary axis code does not \"copy over\" names from discrete breaks as labels for the secondary axis—the labels are typically inherited only if explicitly set, not from *breaks*' names. For a more consistent experience, you want the **names** of *breaks* (when used with discrete scales) to become the secondary axis *labels*, unless labels are explicitly set by the user.\n\n### Key Change Location\n\nYou want to patch the `AxisSecondary$init` method, **within the block that handles discrete scales** — where it currently only copies the breaks.\n\n#### Current code in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n  } else {\n    # [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n#### What we want:\n- If breaks are waiver (i.e., default), get the breaks from the scale as before.\n- **If those breaks have names, and `labels` for the sec.axis are default/derived, set `labels` to those names.**\n\n---\n\n### Modified `AxisSecondary$init` snippet\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      self$breaks <- breaks\n      # --- NEW: Use names for labels if not set otherwise ---\n      if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.null(names(breaks))) {\n        if (any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n          self$labels <- names(breaks)\n        }\n      }\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n## Patch Summary\n\nYou just need to **replace** the `init` method in your `AxisSecondary` ggproto with the above.

By default, **ggplot2**'s secondary axis code does not \"copy over\" names from discrete breaks as labels for the secondary axis—the labels are typically inherited only if explicitly set, not from *breaks*' names. For a more consistent experience, you want the **names** of *breaks* (when used with discrete scales) to become the secondary axis *labels*, unless labels are explicitly set by the user.\n\n### Key Change Location\n\nYou want to patch the `AxisSecondary$init` method, **within the block that handles discrete scales** — where it currently only copies the breaks.\n\n#### Current code in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n  } else {\n    # [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n#### What we want:\n- If breaks are waiver (i.e., default), get the breaks from the scale as before.\n- **If those breaks have names, and `labels` for the sec.axis are default/derived, set `labels` to those names.**\n\n---\n\n### Modified `AxisSecondary$init` snippet\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      self$breaks <- breaks\n      # --- NEW: Use names for labels if not set otherwise ---\n      if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.null(names(breaks))) {\n        if (any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n          self$labels <- names(breaks)\n        }\n      }\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n## Patch Summary\n\nYou just need to **replace** the `init` method in your `AxisSecondary` ggproto with the above.

          "explanation": "I'm evaluating whether the submission correctly addresses the criterion for handling named discrete breaks in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific code changes that need to be made:\n\n1. In the `AxisSecondary$init` method, where discrete breaks are assigned: \n   ```r\n   if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n   } \n   ```\n   should be changed to:\n   ```r\n   if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n     self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n   } \n   ```\n\n2.

By default, `ggplot2`'s handling of labels for axes uses the `labels` argument, and if it's a function/character vector, it uses it; if `waiver()`, it tries to construct them from breaks, etc. But, for discrete axes, if a user passes named breaks and doesn't explicitly set labels, your goal is: **use the names of the breaks as the labels by default**.\n\n### Where to Change\n\nIn your code (specifically `AxisSecondary$init` method), this is the key section:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut this just copies over whatever the primary axis's label spec is (could be a function or `waiver()` etc). What you want is:  \n**If labels are derived, and breaks are a named vector, and the axis is discrete, set labels to the names(breaks) if not NULL, otherwise leave default.**\n\n### Proposed Patch\n\nReplace this block:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nwith\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.waiver(self$breaks) &&\n      !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    # If breaks are named and axis is discrete, use those names as labels\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause the axis to use names(breaks) as labels ONLY if labels are set to derive and at least one name for breaks exists.\n\n---\n\n#### Contextualized in your code:\nHere's the surrounding part of `AxisSecondary$init` patched:\n\n```r\n  # Inherit settings from the primary axis/scale\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    # PATCH BELOW\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.waiver(self$breaks) &&\n          !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Checked only if labels is derived**\n- **Checked if breaks is named (and at least one name is not the empty string)**\n- **Only runs for discrete axes**\n\nNow named breaks will show matching labels on the secondary axis by default.\n\n---\n\n#### Example\n\n```r\np + scale_x_discrete(\n  sec.axis = sec_axis(\n    breaks = c(A=\"foo\", B=\"bar\", C=\"baz\")\n    # labels left as default!\n  )\n)\n# Secondary axis labels will be c(\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\")\n```\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need a patch for continuous axes (e.g., if breaks = c('foo'=1, 'bar'=2)) or want alternate behavior!**\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

By default, `ggplot2`'s handling of labels for axes uses the `labels` argument, and if it's a function/character vector, it uses it; if `waiver()`, it tries to construct them from breaks, etc. But, for discrete axes, if a user passes named breaks and doesn't explicitly set labels, your goal is: **use the names of the breaks as the labels by default**.\n\n### Where to Change\n\nIn your code (specifically `AxisSecondary$init` method), this is the key section:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut this just copies over whatever the primary axis's label spec is (could be a function or `waiver()` etc).

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the proposed solution meets the criterion for allowing discrete breaks with names to be used as labels by default in the secondary axis.\n\nThe criterion specifies that two specific changes should be made:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than preserving the names in the breaks as specified in the criterion, it adds custom logic to check for named breaks and then creates a function that uses those names as labels. \n\nThis approach might functionally achieve a similar result in some cases, but it:\n1. Doesn't implement either of the specific code changes required by the criterion\n2. Adds more complex logic with a function-based approach rather than the simpler name preservation approach specified\n3. Is handling the issue at the labeling stage rather than ensuring the names are preserved at the breaks computation stage\n\nThe submission adds a functional solution to the general problem, but it does not implement the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

You want **discrete scales with named breaks** to use those names as default labels for the secondary axis (unless overridden).\n\n## Where to patch\n\nThis should be handled during the `.init()` of the `AxisSecondary` ggproto (or `break_info()`), but ideally as soon as breaks are assigned, to let scale machinery (and user overrides) act as normal.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. After this line in AxisSecondary$init():\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\ninsert the following logic:\n\n```r\n# If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\nif (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n  if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n    names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n    self$labels <- function(x) {\n      ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n      # fallback to as.character if names missing\n      out <- names_vec[ix]\n      out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n      out\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis assigns a labeling function to `self$labels` **only** when the axis is discrete, the user hasn't specified a custom label set, and breaks have names. It falls back to `as.character(x)` if named match fails.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Full Patch to AxisSecondary$init\n\nReplace the relevant part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n\n  # <<< start addition\n  # If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n    if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n      self$labels <- function(x) {\n        ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n        out <- names_vec[ix]\n        out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n        out\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  # <<< end addition\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Optional: Document Behavior\n\nAdd to the docstring for sec_axis:\n\n> When used with discrete scales, if breaks are provided as a named vector and labels are not explicitly set, the names will be used as axis labels.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Insert the new block in AxisSecondary$init after the block assigning `.labels`.**\nThis ensures that, when the secondary axis is discrete and breaks have names, those names become the labels unless the user overrides it.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like a unified diff or the full updated code block!**\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Doesn't implement either of the specific code changes required by the criterion\n2. Adds more complex logic with a function-based approach rather than the simpler name preservation approach specified\n3.

                      "text": "Certainly! You want **discrete scales with named breaks** to use those names as default labels for the secondary axis (unless overridden).\n\n## Where to patch\n\nThis should be handled during the `.init()` of the `AxisSecondary` ggproto (or `break_info()`), but ideally as soon as breaks are assigned, to let scale machinery (and user overrides) act as normal.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. After this line in AxisSecondary$init():\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\ninsert the following logic:\n\n```r\n# If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\nif (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n  if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n    names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n    self$labels <- function(x) {\n      ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n      # fallback to as.character if names missing\n      out <- names_vec[ix]\n      out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n      out\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis assigns a labeling function to `self$labels` **only** when the axis is discrete, the user hasn't specified a custom label set, and breaks have names. It falls back to `as.character(x)` if named match fails.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Full Patch to AxisSecondary$init\n\nReplace the relevant part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n\n  # <<< start addition\n  # If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n    if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n      self$labels <- function(x) {\n        ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n        out <- names_vec[ix]\n        out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n        out\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  # <<< end addition\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Optional: Document Behavior\n\nAdd to the docstring for sec_axis:\n\n> When used with discrete scales, if breaks are provided as a named vector and labels are not explicitly set, the names will be used as axis labels.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Insert the new block in AxisSecondary$init after the block assigning `.labels`.**\nThis ensures that, when the secondary axis is discrete and breaks have names, those names become the labels unless the user overrides it.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like a unified diff or the full updated code block!**"

                  "text": "Certainly! You want **discrete scales with named breaks** to use those names as default labels for the secondary axis (unless overridden).\n\n## Where to patch\n\nThis should be handled during the `.init()` of the `AxisSecondary` ggproto (or `break_info()`), but ideally as soon as breaks are assigned, to let scale machinery (and user overrides) act as normal.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. After this line in AxisSecondary$init():\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\ninsert the following logic:\n\n```r\n# If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\nif (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n  if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n    names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n    self$labels <- function(x) {\n      ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n      # fallback to as.character if names missing\n      out <- names_vec[ix]\n      out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n      out\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis assigns a labeling function to `self$labels` **only** when the axis is discrete, the user hasn't specified a custom label set, and breaks have names. It falls back to `as.character(x)` if named match fails.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Full Patch to AxisSecondary$init\n\nReplace the relevant part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n\n  # <<< start addition\n  # If breaks are a named vector and labels are defaulted/derived, use names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && (is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels))) {\n    if (is.atomic(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      names_vec <- names(self$breaks)\n      self$labels <- function(x) {\n        ix <- match(x, self$breaks)\n        out <- names_vec[ix]\n        out[is.na(out)] <- as.character(x[is.na(out)])\n        out\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  # <<< end addition\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Optional: Document Behavior\n\nAdd to the docstring for sec_axis:\n\n> When used with discrete scales, if breaks are provided as a named vector and labels are not explicitly set, the names will be used as axis labels.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Insert the new block in AxisSecondary$init after the block assigning `.labels`.**\nThis ensures that, when the secondary axis is discrete and breaks have names, those names become the labels unless the user overrides it.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like a unified diff or the full updated code block!**",

Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.",

The submission uses:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / n\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThis differs from the criterion in a significant way:\n- It summarizes first (calculating n and prop_na_arr_delay), then filters for n >= 100\n- The criterion specifies that we should filter for tailnums with > 100 flights first, then summarize\n\nWhile the submission will produce the correct final result (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights), it uses a different approach than what was specified in the criterion. The calculation of the proportion using na_arr_delay/n is mathematically equivalent to mean(is.na(arr_delay)), but the order of operations differs.\n\nAdditionally, the submission uses filter(n >= 100) rather than filter(n() > 100), which is another minor difference from the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.",

This applies jitter only to the x values.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have data like:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nset.seed(1)\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each=10)),\n  y = rnorm(30)\n)\n```\n\nPlot boxes (or whatever) and jitter points **only along x**:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(\n    position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)\n  )\n```\n\n- `width` controls the amount of jitter in the x direction.\n- `height = 0` ensures **no jitter in the y direction**.\n\n### Equivalent using `geom_jitter()`\n\nAlternatively, `geom_jitter()` is a shortcut for `geom_point(position = position_jitter(...))`:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo jitter only along x in ggplot2, set `width` to a nonzero value and `height = 0` in either `geom_jitter()` or `geom_point(position = position_jitter(...))`.",

That is, it should be:\n\n```r\ninnerServer(session$ns(\"inner1\"))\n```\n\nOtherwise, the UI (correctly using `ns`), produces `outer1-inner1-*` as ID, but your server submodules are just `inner1-*`, so the outputs don't match up; you get a header but nothing else.\n\n---\n\n### Explicit fix (summary)\n\n**You must call innerServer with `session$ns(\"inner1\")`** (not just \"inner1\") in your outerServer.\n\n---\n\n## Full, working code\n\nHere's your example, fixed:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # CRITICAL FIX: Use session$ns to namespace the IDs for submodules!\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n- **For nested modules, always use `session$ns()` inside the parent moduleServer when invoking submodules!**\n    - UI: use the parent's `ns()` wrapper as in your original\n    - Server: use `session$ns()` (not your own call to `NS`, which can sometimes misbehave when layered).\n- Don't manually recompute `ns <- NS(id)`. Use the passed-in `session$ns` within the module's server function.\n\nThis works for *any* depth of module nesting. Now your `verbatimTextOutput` and `plotOutput` will show up as expected!",

Therefore, the server logic is **not using the correct namespace**, and so outputs from inside `renderUI` won't be found.\n\n---\n\n## **The Solution**\n\nWhenever you use `inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))`, the corresponding `innerServer` needs to be called as `innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))`.\n\nSo, fix your `outerServer` to:\n\n```r\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Full working code**\n\nBelow is your working application:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns # use session-provided ns!\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary/Key rule**\n\n**Always use the same id in your module server as you used in the module UI, including all necessary namespace prefixes.**\n\nIf you use `ns(\"something\")` in your UI, use the same in the server.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus tip\n\nInside server functions *inside* `moduleServer`, it's generally preferred to use `session$ns`, which is provided automatically. So, for your `innerServer` you can just do:\n\n```r\nmoduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n  ns <- session$ns\n  # ...\n})\n```\n\nThis avoids confusion and works for all module nesting scenarios.",
          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies and resolves the issue with namespaces in nested Shiny modules.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core namespace problem in the code:\n1. It points out that the outer module is calling inner modules with direct IDs (`innerServer(\"inner1\")`) but the UI is using namespaced IDs (`inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))`)\n2. It correctly explains that this mismatch causes the server logic to use incorrect namespaces\n3. It provides the correct solution of using `innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))` in the outer server function\n4. It also recommends using `session$ns` inside moduleServer instead of creating a new namespace with `NS(id)`\n\nThe submission's explanation aligns perfectly with the criterion, which specifically mentions that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules, while `session$ns` ensures properly-qualified namespaces.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission would correctly fix the issue with the dynamically generated UI elements not displaying properly.\n\nGRADE: C",

              "text": "You are running into a **case sensitivity** and **repository naming** issue with how R resolves package dependencies when installing from GitHub.\n\n### What's Happening?\n\n- R package dependencies (i.e., names listed in `Imports:`) **must match the `Package:` field in the dependency's `DESCRIPTION` file**—the _case_ matters (e.g., `spatialstuff` vs `SpatialStuff`).\n- The `Remotes:` entry in your `DESCRIPTION` tells R/pak/devtools to look for the package on GitHub at `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- `pak` is seeing an `Imports: spatialstuff` and trying to find a CRAN package called `spatialstuff` (lowercase), not finding it, and not making the connection to the GitHub repo because the package directory/repo is called `spatial-Stuff` (with a capital S and a hyphen).\n\n### What should you check/fix?\n\n1. **Check the actual package name in its DESCRIPTION**\n\n   Clone or browse [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff), and look at `spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION`. Find:\n\n   ```\n   Package: ????\n   ```\n\n   - If it says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase, no dash): your `Imports` and code are correct.\n   - If it says `Package: spatial-Stuff` (dash or uppercase): YOUR `Imports` **must exactly match** this, i.e., `Imports: spatial-Stuff`.\n\n2. **Check your `Remotes` entry**\n\n   `Remotes` tells R where to fetch a non-CRAN dependency. Your line is correct _if_ that's the location:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Be aware of case/dash mismatches**\n\n   R is case-sensitive for package names. Pak/devtools will try to match your `Imports` (`spatialstuff`) with the `Package:` field from the GitHub repo.\n\n   - If these do not match _exactly_ (case- and dash-wise), installation fails and you get \"Can't find package called spatialstuff\".\n\n### Possible Scenarios\n\n#### 1. **DESCRIPTION mismatch**\n\nIf upstream's `DESCRIPTION` says:\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nand you have\n```\nImports: spatialstuff\n```\n—**this will fail**!\n\n**Solution:**  \nAdapt your `Imports` to match _exactly_ the name in `DESCRIPTION`:\n\n```\nImports: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nOr, ideally, fix upstream to standardize (if possible).\n\n#### 2. **CRAN lookup confusion**\nIf you wrote `Imports: spatialstuff` and did not specify `Remotes`, R will try CRAN only. But you have a `Remotes` line, so it should look at both places. If it still fails, the names probably do not match.\n\n#### 3. **Other conflicts**\nIf spatialstuff itself (or another dependency) fails to install due to a conflicting dependency (e.g. versions), you might also get a similar error, but from your error message it's a direct name mismatch.\n\n### **How to Fix**\n\n**Action items:**\n\n- Go to: https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION\n- Find the `Package:` value.\n- Make sure your `Imports:` and any code referring to that package use **exactly** that spelling/case/punctuation.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf their DESCRIPTION says:\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nYour DESCRIPTION must say:\n```yaml\nImports:\n  spatial-Stuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n**If it's `spatialstuff`:**\n```yaml\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| `Package:` in dependency DESCRIPTION | Your `Imports:`   | Your `Remotes:`                |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `spatial-Stuff`                      | spatial-Stuff     | org/spatial-Stuff             |\n| `spatialstuff`                       | spatialstuff      | org/spatial-Stuff             |\n\n- They **must all match** (except for the repo name, which is just the GitHub path).\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R package DESCRIPTION file: Remotes field](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#remotes)\n- [Hadley Wickham: R is case sensitive for package names](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/246)\n- [CRAN Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html): \"Package names must consist of only uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers, and must start with a letter, not a number.\"\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- Make sure the package name in your `Imports:` and `Remotes:` matches **exactly** the `Package:` field in the dependency's DESCRIPTION file (case and punctuation included).\n- R's package installation machinery is **case sensitive** and will not map between `spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff`.\n\nLet me know if you need help checking the actual DESCRIPTION file or adapting your YAML!"

                  "text": "You are running into a **case sensitivity** and **repository naming** issue with how R resolves package dependencies when installing from GitHub.\n\n### What's Happening?\n\n- R package dependencies (i.e., names listed in `Imports:`) **must match the `Package:` field in the dependency's `DESCRIPTION` file**—the _case_ matters (e.g., `spatialstuff` vs `SpatialStuff`).\n- The `Remotes:` entry in your `DESCRIPTION` tells R/pak/devtools to look for the package on GitHub at `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- `pak` is seeing an `Imports: spatialstuff` and trying to find a CRAN package called `spatialstuff` (lowercase), not finding it, and not making the connection to the GitHub repo because the package directory/repo is called `spatial-Stuff` (with a capital S and a hyphen).\n\n### What should you check/fix?\n\n1. **Check the actual package name in its DESCRIPTION**\n\n   Clone or browse [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff), and look at `spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION`. Find:\n\n   ```\n   Package: ????\n   ```\n\n   - If it says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase, no dash): your `Imports` and code are correct.\n   - If it says `Package: spatial-Stuff` (dash or uppercase): YOUR `Imports` **must exactly match** this, i.e., `Imports: spatial-Stuff`.\n\n2. **Check your `Remotes` entry**\n\n   `Remotes` tells R where to fetch a non-CRAN dependency. Your line is correct _if_ that's the location:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Be aware of case/dash mismatches**\n\n   R is case-sensitive for package names. Pak/devtools will try to match your `Imports` (`spatialstuff`) with the `Package:` field from the GitHub repo.\n\n   - If these do not match _exactly_ (case- and dash-wise), installation fails and you get \"Can't find package called spatialstuff\".\n\n### Possible Scenarios\n\n#### 1. **DESCRIPTION mismatch**\n\nIf upstream's `DESCRIPTION` says:\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nand you have\n```\nImports: spatialstuff\n```\n—**this will fail**!\n\n**Solution:**  \nAdapt your `Imports` to match _exactly_ the name in `DESCRIPTION`:\n\n```\nImports: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nOr, ideally, fix upstream to standardize (if possible).\n\n#### 2. **CRAN lookup confusion**\nIf you wrote `Imports: spatialstuff` and did not specify `Remotes`, R will try CRAN only. But you have a `Remotes` line, so it should look at both places. If it still fails, the names probably do not match.\n\n#### 3. **Other conflicts**\nIf spatialstuff itself (or another dependency) fails to install due to a conflicting dependency (e.g. versions), you might also get a similar error, but from your error message it's a direct name mismatch.\n\n### **How to Fix**\n\n**Action items:**\n\n- Go to: https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION\n- Find the `Package:` value.\n- Make sure your `Imports:` and any code referring to that package use **exactly** that spelling/case/punctuation.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf their DESCRIPTION says:\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nYour DESCRIPTION must say:\n```yaml\nImports:\n  spatial-Stuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n**If it's `spatialstuff`:**\n```yaml\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| `Package:` in dependency DESCRIPTION | Your `Imports:`   | Your `Remotes:`                |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `spatial-Stuff`                      | spatial-Stuff     | org/spatial-Stuff             |\n| `spatialstuff`                       | spatialstuff      | org/spatial-Stuff             |\n\n- They **must all match** (except for the repo name, which is just the GitHub path).\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R package DESCRIPTION file: Remotes field](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#remotes)\n- [Hadley Wickham: R is case sensitive for package names](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/246)\n- [CRAN Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html): \"Package names must consist of only uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers, and must start with a letter, not a number.\"\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- Make sure the package name in your `Imports:` and `Remotes:` matches **exactly** the `Package:` field in the dependency's DESCRIPTION file (case and punctuation included).\n- R's package installation machinery is **case sensitive** and will not map between `spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff`.\n\nLet me know if you need help checking the actual DESCRIPTION file or adapting your YAML!",

How does R (and install tools) resolve this?**\n\n- The **Remotes** field tells R (and tools like `pak` and `devtools`) where to get the package `spatialstuff` **if it isn't on CRAN**.\n- **Remotes** are only consulted _if_ the package manager can't find a matching package on CRAN/BioC/etc.\n\n- The repo can have a different name than the R package **as long as the `.Rproj` and `DESCRIPTION` inside the repo say `Package: spatialstuff`**.\n\n  > For example, on GitHub: `org/spatial-Stuff` could contain a `DESCRIPTION` file `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **R Package Dependencies and Remotes**\n\n- **DESCRIPTION:**\n  ```r\n  Imports:\n    spatialstuff\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n- This tells `devtools`, `pak`, and other R tools:\n  - *Import* a package called **`spatialstuff`**.\n  - *When installing, get it from* **`org/spatial-Stuff`** (not CRAN).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Core Issue**\n\n- R figures out what package to install by **matching the package name** in your Imports (`spatialstuff`) with what's available either on CRAN, Bioconductor, or custom Remotes.\n- **GitHub** packages can use a different *repo name* from the *package name* (from `DESCRIPTION`).\n- The **`Remotes`** field's value (`org/spatial-Stuff`) says \"Install from this GitHub repo.\"\n  - The actual **package name** R expects to find inside this repo is `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **What Goes Wrong?**\n\n- Your workflow cannot find **spatialstuff**:\n  ```\n  Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n- This means:\n  - The GitHub repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) **doesn't contain a package whose `Package:` field is `spatialstuff`** in `DESCRIPTION`.\n  - Or, perhaps, **case sensitivity** is an issue (e.g., `SpatialStuff` vs `spatialstuff`).\n- **`pak`** and other tools rely on the `DESCRIPTION`'s `Package:` field *inside the repo.*\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n#### a) **Check the package name in the repo**\n\nGo to [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff) and look at the `DESCRIPTION` file. The very first line should be:\n```r\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nIf it says *anything else* (e.g., `spatialStuff`), **that is the problem**.\n\n> **R and its package managers are *case-sensitive*** for package names.\n\n#### b) **Repository / Remotes syntax is fine**\n\n- `org/spatial-Stuff` is a valid Remotes entry; the repo name and org do **not** have to match the package's `Package:` field. What matters is the actual content of the `DESCRIPTION` in the upstream repo.\n\n#### c) **Other common issues**\n\n- **Multiple package folders in a repo:** If the repo contains multiple packages (i.e., `/pkg1`, `/pkg2` at the top level), you need to specify the subdir in Remotes:\n\n  ```r\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n  ```\n- **Repository not public:** If you're using Github Actions or pkgdown workflows, make sure the repo is public or provide personal access tokens for private repos.\n\n- **Dependency tree issues:** Sometimes complex dependency chains can confuse pkgdown build tools; you may want to try `pak::pkg_install()` locally with the same Remotes to reproduce the error outside GitHub Actions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Local Reproducibility**\n\nTry locally:\n```r\npak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nIf this fails with \"Can't find package called spatialstuff\", it 100% means that the `DESCRIPTION` in that repo uses a different `Package:` field.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Imports value | Remotes value        | Repo/DESCRIPTION expectation  |\n|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| spatialstuff  | org/spatial-Stuff   | Contains `Package: spatialstuff` (case-sensitive) in `DESCRIPTION` |\n| spatialStuff  | org/spatial-Stuff   | Contains `Package: spatialStuff` (must match exactly)              |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion/Answer**\n\nThis is **not a user error on your part**, if the repo's `DESCRIPTION` says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase).  \nBut **if the actual `DESCRIPTION` has a different value (case or spelling), that is the problem**.  \nR package installations are strictly based on the `Package:` name in `DESCRIPTION`, which *must* match what you have in `Imports`.\n\n---\n\n## **What To Do?**\n\n- **Check that the upstream repo `DESCRIPTION` starts with `Package: spatialstuff` (lowercase).**\n- If not, ask the maintainers to fix it. The repo name (`spatial-Stuff`) is fine; it's the internal package name that matters.\n- If they won't fix it, you must use the name *as specified in their `DESCRIPTION`* everywhere—your `Imports`, `Remotes`, and source code.\n\nIf the repo actually has the right `Package:` line and it still fails, there may be another issue (like GitHub access or monorepo layout), but 95% of the time this is simply a **case mismatch or filename mismatch**.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [`devtools` Remotes syntax](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)\n- [`pak` package solving](https://pak.r-lib.org/)\n- [R Packages book, GitHub dependencies](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset.html)\n- [Case sensitivity in R package names (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57509863/r-package-names-are-they-case-sensitive)\n\n---\n\n**If you post the exact first line of their `DESCRIPTION`, we can confirm this 100%.**"

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **R Package Dependencies and Remotes**\n\n- **DESCRIPTION:**\n  ```r\n  Imports:\n    spatialstuff\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n- This tells `devtools`, `pak`, and other R tools:\n  - *Import* a package called **`spatialstuff`**.\n  - *When installing, get it from* **`org/spatial-Stuff`** (not CRAN).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Core Issue**\n\n- R figures out what package to install by **matching the package name** in your Imports (`spatialstuff`) with what's available either on CRAN, Bioconductor, or custom Remotes.\n- **GitHub** packages can use a different *repo name* from the *package name* (from `DESCRIPTION`).\n- The **`Remotes`** field's value (`org/spatial-Stuff`) says \"Install from this GitHub repo.\"\n  - The actual **package name** R expects to find inside this repo is `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **What Goes Wrong?**\n\n- Your workflow cannot find **spatialstuff**:\n  ```\n  Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n- This means:\n  - The GitHub repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) **doesn't contain a package whose `Package:` field is `spatialstuff`** in `DESCRIPTION`.\n  - Or, perhaps, **case sensitivity** is an issue (e.g., `SpatialStuff` vs `spatialstuff`).\n- **`pak`** and other tools rely on the `DESCRIPTION`'s `Package:` field *inside the repo.*\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n#### a) **Check the package name in the repo**\n\nGo to [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff) and look at the `DESCRIPTION` file. The very first line should be:\n```r\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nIf it says *anything else* (e.g., `spatialStuff`), **that is the problem**.\n\n> **R and its package managers are *case-sensitive*** for package names.\n\n#### b) **Repository / Remotes syntax is fine**\n\n- `org/spatial-Stuff` is a valid Remotes entry; the repo name and org do **not** have to match the package's `Package:` field. What matters is the actual content of the `DESCRIPTION` in the upstream repo.\n\n#### c) **Other common issues**\n\n- **Multiple package folders in a repo:** If the repo contains multiple packages (i.e., `/pkg1`, `/pkg2` at the top level), you need to specify the subdir in Remotes:\n\n  ```r\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n  ```\n- **Repository not public:** If you're using Github Actions or pkgdown workflows, make sure the repo is public or provide personal access tokens for private repos.\n\n- **Dependency tree issues:** Sometimes complex dependency chains can confuse pkgdown build tools; you may want to try `pak::pkg_install()` locally with the same Remotes to reproduce the error outside GitHub Actions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Local Reproducibility**\n\nTry locally:\n```r\npak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nIf this fails with \"Can't find package called spatialstuff\", it 100% means that the `DESCRIPTION` in that repo uses a different `Package:` field.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Imports value | Remotes value        | Repo/DESCRIPTION expectation  |\n|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| spatialstuff  | org/spatial-Stuff   | Contains `Package: spatialstuff` (case-sensitive) in `DESCRIPTION` |\n| spatialStuff  | org/spatial-Stuff   | Contains `Package: spatialStuff` (must match exactly)              |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion/Answer**\n\nThis is **not a user error on your part**, if the repo's `DESCRIPTION` says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase).  \nBut **if the actual `DESCRIPTION` has a different value (case or spelling), that is the problem**.  \nR package installations are strictly based on the `Package:` name in `DESCRIPTION`, which *must* match what you have in `Imports`.\n\n---\n\n## **What To Do?**\n\n- **Check that the upstream repo `DESCRIPTION` starts with `Package: spatialstuff` (lowercase).**\n- If not, ask the maintainers to fix it. The repo name (`spatial-Stuff`) is fine; it's the internal package name that matters.\n- If they won't fix it, you must use the name *as specified in their `DESCRIPTION`* everywhere—your `Imports`, `Remotes`, and source code.\n\nIf the repo actually has the right `Package:` line and it still fails, there may be another issue (like GitHub access or monorepo layout), but 95% of the time this is simply a **case mismatch or filename mismatch**.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [`devtools` Remotes syntax](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)\n- [`pak` package solving](https://pak.r-lib.org/)\n- [R Packages book, GitHub dependencies](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset.html)\n- [Case sensitivity in R package names (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57509863/r-package-names-are-they-case-sensitive)\n\n---\n\n**If you post the exact first line of their `DESCRIPTION`, we can confirm this 100%.**"

Pick one style for adding methods, not both.\n\n### 1. **Declare `foo` as a method in `public` for Parent**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\nNow the usual R6 inheritance, override, and super-calling will work as expected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **If you must dynamically create/overwrite methods, unlock bindings (not recommended)**\n\nIf you use `lock_bindings = FALSE` when defining the class (not `lock_objects`), you *can* override methods dynamically, but this is **not recommended** in most R programming. Also, you must set this for the parent **and** child.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_bindings = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\nThen your code above will work, *but*, you are defeating much of R6's safety through this. You may face confusion and surprising bugs if users call a method whose definition changes at runtime.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Method Added In       | `public` list? | Dynamic in `initialize`? | Works with inheritance? |\n|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Use `public` only     | Yes            | No                       | Yes (recommended!)      |\n| Use dynamic only      | No             | Yes                      | Yes (less standard)     |\n| Use both              | Yes            | Yes                      | **No**                  |\n\n# **Recommendation**\n\n- **Declare your methods in `public`** and not via dynamic assignment in `initialize`.\n- If you need per-instance method differences, consider using fields or other design patterns, not method re-assignment.\n\n# **Fixed Version**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print(\"foo from child\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"foo\"\n# [1] \"foo from child\"\n```\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:**  \n> **Do not dynamically assign methods in `initialize` for method names that are also in the `public` list, including subclasses.

The key points:\n\n- Methods added *dynamically* to `self` (e.g., via `self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() ...`) are **not recognized** as *class methods* by R6, but as per-instance methods.\n- When you try to **override** such a method in a subclass *via `public = list(foo = ...)`*, R6 wants to initialize that as a standard method, which leads to a **conflict** because the binding (set dynamically) is locked at that point.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n---\n\n## Why do you get this error?\n\n- In `Parent`, you insert `foo` into the instance in `initialize()`, not in the class's `public` list.\n- In `Child`, you declare `foo` as a public method.\n- When R6 tries to construct the `Child` object, it attempts to set `self$foo`, but the dynamic assignment in `initialize()` has already set and locked it—as an environment binding—hence the error.\n\n---\n\n## **How do you fix this?**\n\n### **1. Always declare methods in the `public` list**\n\nDon't dynamically assign methods like `self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...` unless absolutely necessary, and especially not if you intend inheritance.\n\n**Just put `foo` in the `public` list of `Parent`:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. If you must create methods dynamically, do NOT override them in `public` of subclasses**\n\nIf your use-case really needs injecting methods per-instance in `initialize()`, then **don't override them using the class definition**. You have to do all overriding by dynamic assignment as well, e.g. in the subclass's `initialize()` method.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"parent foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('child foo')\n        # If you really must call parent: super$foo() won't work!\n        # You'd have to store the parent method under another name before overriding.\n      }\n    }\n    # Do NOT declare foo here!\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"child foo\"\n```\n**Note:** If you want to call the parent method, you have to save it before you override with the child's function.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| How Parent method is created         | Can be overridden via subclass `public`? |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| In public list                      | Yes                                      |\n| Dynamically in `initialize()`        | No (use dynamic assignment only)         |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice**\n\n**Avoid dynamically adding methods to R6 objects if you expect classes/objects to be inherited and overridden.**  \nDeclare all methods in the `public` list for proper inheritance and easier maintainability!\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R6 Inheritance caveat in documentation](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#inheritance)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nDeclare `foo` in the `public` list of `Parent`. If you must add it dynamically, don't try to override it via the class declaration."

Always declare methods in the `public` list**\n\nDon't dynamically assign methods like `self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...` unless absolutely necessary, and especially not if you intend inheritance.\n\n**Just put `foo` in the `public` list of `Parent`:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. If you must create methods dynamically, do NOT override them in `public` of subclasses**\n\nIf your use-case really needs injecting methods per-instance in `initialize()`, then **don't override them using the class definition**. You have to do all overriding by dynamic assignment as well, e.g. in the subclass's `initialize()` method.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"parent foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('child foo')\n        # If you really must call parent: super$foo() won't work!\n        # You'd have to store the parent method under another name before overriding.\n      }\n    }\n    # Do NOT declare foo here!\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"child foo\"\n```\n**Note:** If you want to call the parent method, you have to save it before you override with the child's function.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| How Parent method is created         | Can be overridden via subclass `public`? |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| In public list                      | Yes                                      |\n| Dynamically in `initialize()`        | No (use dynamic assignment only)         |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice**\n\n**Avoid dynamically adding methods to R6 objects if you expect classes/objects to be inherited and overridden.**  \nDeclare all methods in the `public` list for proper inheritance and easier maintainability!\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R6 Inheritance caveat in documentation](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#inheritance)\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nDeclare `foo` in the `public` list of `Parent`.

Due to R's lazy evaluation and the way promises are constructed, this leads to self-referential evaluation (\"promise already under evaluation\") — i.e., a recursive loop trying to resolve the value.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix\n\nThere are **two main fixes**:\n\n### **A) Avoid using the same argument name in nested functions**\n\nChange either the outer or inner `chat` argument name, and pass explicitly:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat_instance = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat = chat_instance) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Call:**\n```r\nfn <- generate()\nfn(\"Hi!\")  # should work now\n```\n  \n### **B) Capture the value in a local variable**\n\nAnother idiom is to **remove the inner default**, and handle the defaulting inside the body of the function:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    ch <- if (!is.null(chat_override)) chat_override$clone() else chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nNow, the default is always the outer `chat`, but you can override it if you wish.\n\n---\n\n## **Short Explanation**\n\n- R evaluates function arguments **lazily**;\n- If a default argument's expression refers to a *variable* of the same name in an enclosing scope, it can cause **recursive resolution** if both are promises, leading to this error;\n- Solution: avoid shadowing variables or default arguments with the same name, or use local variables to capture values.\n\n---\n\n## **In summary**\n\nChange:\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat = chat) { ... }\n```\n\nto\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat = chat_instance) { ... }\n```\n\n**Or** use another variable name entirely.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nDon't use the same variable name for both an outer and an inner function default, where the inner default refers to the outer parameter. Use different names or set the value via a local variable."

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion of providing a valid fix by either changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object to a differently named variable internally.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n1. The answer clearly explains the problem - that using the same name `chat` in both the outer and inner function's parameter list (especially with `chat = chat` default) creates recursion issues during promise evaluation.\n\n2. The submission provides three options to fix the problem:\n   - Option 1: Use a different name for the inner parameter (changing `chat` to `mychat`)\n   - Option 2: Use `force()` in the outer function (this addresses the problem but still keeps the same parameter name)\n   - Option 3: Don't provide a default in the inner function, use a different approach\n\n3. The submission specifically recommends changing the parameter name as the cleanest solution, showing examples using `chat2` instead of `chat` for the inner function.\n\nAll of these solutions satisfy the criterion that the fix involves \"changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\"\n\nThe answer is thorough, technically correct, and directly addresses the criterion with multiple valid approaches.\n\nGRADE: C",

The answer clearly explains the problem - that using the same name `chat` in both the outer and inner function's parameter list (especially with `chat = chat` default) creates recursion issues during promise evaluation.\n\n2. The submission provides three options to fix the problem:\n   - Option 1: Use a different name for the inner parameter (changing `chat` to `mychat`)\n   - Option 2: Use `force()` in the outer function (this addresses the problem but still keeps the same parameter name)\n   - Option 3: Don't provide a default in the inner function, use a different approach\n\n3. The submission specifically recommends changing the parameter name as the cleanest solution, showing examples using `chat2` instead of `chat` for the inner function.\n\nAll of these solutions satisfy the criterion that the fix involves \"changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\"\n\nThe answer is thorough, technically correct, and directly addresses the criterion with multiple valid approaches.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies the issue with the Shiny app and provides an appropriate solution according to the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the core problem: the `output$plot` alone in the server function without its definition\n2. Recognizes that reactive elements and outputs need to be inside the server function\n3. Provides a complete solution that moves the reactive expressions and output rendering code inside the server function\n4. Explains that the error \"Can't read output 'plot'\" occurs because the plot was referenced but never defined in the server context\n\nThe solution in the submission is comprehensive and addresses all the issues with the original code. It properly restructures the app by moving all reactive elements into the server function, which matches the approach described in the criterion.\n\nThe submission actually goes a bit beyond the criterion by:\n- Improving the reactive code structure with `req()`\n- Adding data validation\n- Refining the data loading approach\n- Providing detailed explanation of why the error occurred\n\nThese additional improvements don't contradict the criterion but enhance the solution further.\n\nThe solution in the submission matches the core fix required by the criterion - moving the output$plot definition and all reactive elements into the server function.\n\nGRADE: C",

In your Shiny app, the server function must *define* all reactives and outputs (like `output$plot`) inside its block.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix:**\n\n**Put all reactives and output code into your `server` function.**  \nHere's a corrected version:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if(nrow(data) == 0)\n      return(NULL)\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key points:**\n\n- All code that uses `input` or `output` needs to be **inside** the server function, **not** in the global environment.\n- Reactives and outputs (`reactive()`, `renderPlot()`, etc.) are server-scoped!\n- Pass both `ui` and the *newly defined* `server` to `shinyApp()`.\n\n---\n**Bonus tip:**  \nIf you want to *inspect* your variables for debugging, use `str(data)` or `print(data)` inside the `renderPlot` block, temporarily. Also, look out in your filter: `filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, ...)`, not `== ckd_condition` (which is a function, not a value).\n\n---\n\n**Your error message (\"Error in output$plot: Can't read output 'plot'\") basically means: You told Shiny to use `output$plot`, but you never actually defined it in the active server context.**  \n\nBy putting your outputs/reactives in `server`, the error will vanish!\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies the main issue in the Shiny app code and provides an appropriate solution according to the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core problem: the server function is improperly structured with `output$plot` being referenced but not assigned within the anonymous server function. The submitted answer explains that all reactive elements and the `renderPlot()` code need to be moved inside the server function.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission:\n1. Correctly moves all reactive code inside the server function\n2. Properly assigns `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` inside the server \n3. Correctly uses input references directly (`input$condition` instead of separate reactives)\n4. Restructures the app to use a named server function rather than an anonymous one\n\nThis solution addresses exactly what the criterion describes - moving the output$plot and rendering code into a proper server function. The submission goes beyond the minimal fix by also explaining the reasoning behind the error and cleaning up other aspects of the code.\n\nWhile the solution in the submission is slightly different in structure from the one in the criterion (using `session` parameter and reorganizing some other code), these differences don't affect the core fix, which is moving the plot rendering into the server function.\n\nGRADE: C",

If you want to use helper functions, define those outside, but the parts that use `input` and especially `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` must be **inside**.\n\n### How to fix your app\n\n- Put the `reactive` objects and the `output$plot` code inside `server`.\n- Pass your data into `server` as needed.\n\nHere's your app, **corrected** and refactored for clarity:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # All reactives and outputs go INSIDE server\n  \n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if(nrow(data) == 0) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"No data available for this selection\")\n      return()\n    }\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key issues in your original code:\n\n1. **Misplaced output and reactives:**  \n   `output$plot` and the `reactive()` objects were *outside* server, so were not connected to Shiny's input/output system.\n\n2. **Passing code to shinyApp():**  \n   You wrote:\n   ```r\n   shinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n     output$plot\n   })\n   ```\n   which only passes a reference to `output$plot` (which doesn't exist at that scope!) instead of all the logic.\n\n3. **Filter issue:**  \n   You wrote:\n   ```r\n   filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold)\n   ```\n   This should use the value, not the function: `input$condition` inside server, or if you keep it as a reactive, then `ckd_condition()`.\n\n4. **Best Practice:**  \n   All use of `input$...` and `output$...` go inside `server`.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Where             | Original                | Corrected                  |\n|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| global env        | output$plot <- ...      | (do not do this!)          |\n| server arg        | output$plot             | see full server above      |\n| filter            | CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition | CKD_STAGE == input$condition |\n| reactives         | global                  | inside server              |\n\n---\n\n## General Rule\n\n**Shiny's `server` function is where all the magic happens!  \nAll input and output logic (including reactives) go inside it.**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you get stuck on any specific error after making these changes!",

In this case, `out$refresh_token` triggers a partial match, which is fragile and now generates a warning.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nUse double brackets (`[[`) with the **exact name** to avoid partial matching:\n\n```r\nout[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n```\n\n**Full corrected function:**\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `out[[\"refresh_token\"]]` instead of `out$refresh_token` to guarantee exact, safe matching.\n- This prevents the issue when a new, similar key (e.g., `refresh_token_expires_in`) appears in the response.",

Since you want to **replace the first pipe pair (`||`) with \"T\"** and the **second with \"A\"**, you need to do a **sequential replacement**, not a global one.\n\nHere’s how you can do it with tidyverse:\n\n```r\n# your data\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result2 = appointment_key %>%\n      str_replace_fixed(\"||\", \"T\", 1) %>%    # replace first occurrence\n      str_replace_fixed(\"||\", \"A\", 1)        # then replace second\n  )\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  referral_key appointment_key result       result2      \n  <chr>        <chr>           <chr>        <chr>        \n1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1 4289T10410A1\n2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2 4289T10410A2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `str_replace_fixed(\"||\", \"T\", 1)`: replaces the **first** `||` with `T`\n- Then, replacing the **(now) first** remaining `||` with `A`\n\nThis preserves any other `|`s if they exist elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using Regular Expressions\n\nIf you want to be more flexible, split and paste:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result2 = appointment_key %>% \n      str_split_fixed(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", 3) %>%\n      as.data.frame() %>%\n      transmute(result2 = paste0(V1, \"T\", V2, \"A\", V3)) %>%\n      pull(result2)\n  )\n```\n\nBut the sequential `str_replace_fixed()` approach is the cleanest for this structured task.",

The **third edition** of `testthat` introduces **expectation functions** that take **regular expressions** using the `.pattern` argument, and it generally encourages the use of more explicit code blocks for scoping warnings. It also introduces `expect_snapshot()` for some cases, but for warnings, the direct analog to your code is to use `expect_warning()`.\n\nHowever, in 3rd edition, you are encouraged to use `expect_warning()` with the **bare string** for the regular expression to match, and `.pattern = TRUE` is not needed unless you'd like more control (it's not typically required).\n\nYou **should** avoid double-backslashes in the string, as regular R strings pass directly to `grepl` within `expect_warning()`. So `\"\\\\`exponentiate\\\\` argument...\"` can be written as `` \"`exponentiate` argument...\" ``.\n\nHere's your code in preferred 3rd edition style:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported exponentiate triggers warning\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n**Key changes and notes:**\n- Wrap the expectation in a `test_that()` block.\n- Regular expressions in 3rd edition wildcards no longer need excessive escaping—so backticks are not escaped.\n- The matched string argument is interpreted as a regular expression by default; use raw strings or escape only when needed.\n- Use [testthat v3 edition guide](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html) as needed for further migration.\n\n**In summary:**\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported exponentiate triggers warning\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```",

For a single column, you can just give the new name in `mutate()`, but with `across()` it expects a glue string, not a column name.\n   \n2. **Extra comma:**  \n   There's an unnecessary comma after `\"x\"`.\n\n3. **across() for one column:**  \n   If you just want to mutate a single column with a new name, you don't need `across()`. Use:\n   ```r\n   mtcars |> mutate(vs2 = vs + 1)\n   ```\n   If you want the name to be generated, `.names` should be like `\"{.col}_new\"` or another glue string, and the result will be a new column.\n\n4. **Lambda syntax:**  \n   `\\(x) x + 1` is fine in recent R versions. If you hit odd errors, try the long-form: `function(x) x + 1`.\n\n## Correct usages\n\n### 1.

For a single column, you can just give the new name in `mutate()`, but with `across()` it expects a glue string, not a column name.\n   \n2. **Extra comma:**  \n   There's an unnecessary comma after `\"x\"`.\n\n3. **across() for one column:**  \n   If you just want to mutate a single column with a new name, you don't need `across()`. Use:\n   ```r\n   mtcars |> mutate(vs2 = vs + 1)\n   ```\n   If you want the name to be generated, `.names` should be like `\"{.col}_new\"` or another glue string, and the result will be a new column.\n\n4. **Lambda syntax:**  \n   `\\(x) x + 1` is fine in recent R versions.

Syntax of Lambda Functions (`\\()`)**\n- The shorthand lambda syntax `\\()` for anonymous functions is supported only in R 4.1.0+.\n- For older versions, use `function(x) x + 1`.\n\n**2. `.names` argument**\n- `.names` controls the name/template for the new column(s).  \n- You set `.names = \"x\"`, which means the resulting column will literally be named `x` (OK if you want that).\n- Typically, people use something like `.names = \"{.col}_new\"`.\n\n**3. The extra comma**\n- You have a dangling comma after `.names = \"x\",` ― not harmful, but not idiomatic.\n\n**4. `across()` over a single column**\n- Use `across()` for multiple columns; for a single column, it's more direct to write:\n  ```r\n  mutate(vs2 = vs + 1)\n  ```\n\nBut `across()` is valid if you want to use its features.\n\n### The specific error details:\n- The error `! Unused argument (alist())` often happens if you call the lambda incorrectly or have a typo in the anonymous function syntax (for example, using `\\x` instead of `\\(x)`), **or if your dplyr version is old and doesn't understand the shorthand lambda.**\n\n### Solution/Fix\n\n#### **Option 1: Using function() syntax**\nThis will work reliably on all R/dplyr versions:\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, function(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n- This will create a new column named `x` with `vs + 1`.\n\n#### **Option 2: Using lambda (\\()) syntax (R 4.1+)**\nMake sure your R is 4.1 or higher:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\n#### **Option 3: Improve naming (if desired)**\nIf you want to keep the original column and make a new one named, say, `vs_plus1`:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n#### **Option 4: Just mutate for a single column**\nIf you just want `vs + 1` as a new column (`vs2`), no need for across:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs2 = vs + 1)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why the error happened\n\n- Using the anonymous function notation `\\()` in an old version of dplyr/R can yield strange errors like **\"Unused argument (alist())\"**.\n- The `.names = \"x\",` syntax is okay, but the trailing comma is unusual.\n- Strange errors after that (e.g., `object '栀Ƭ' not found`) are likely from garbled output or user copying issues, not part of the core problem.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Preferred fix:**  \n  ```r\n  mtcars |> mutate(across(vs, function(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n  ```\n- Or update R/dplyr and use the `\\(x) x + 1` lambda.\n\n- Be careful with the `.names` argument; use templates if making many columns.\n\n**Let me know your actual R and dplyr versions for more targeted help!**"

You set `.names = \"x\"`—this is legal, but only useful when you're mutating multiple columns and want all the new columns to have certain names (and even then, it's risky because of possible name collisions).\n\nBut in your case, since you're just modifying one column and not really \"creating\" new columns, the default naming is fine, or you can give a proper template.\n\n#### Also, the trailing comma at the end of the arguments:\n```r\n... .names = \"x\", )  # <-- trailing comma is not needed and can cause problems.\n```\n\n### 2. **Anonymous function**\nYou're using `\\(x) x + 1`, which is fine—but your error message actually refers to `function(x) x + 1`, which is also fine, so the root issue is likely not here.\n\n### 3. **Usage and intent**\nIf you want to **replace** the `vs` column with its values plus one, you don't even need `across`, just `mutate(vs = vs + 1)`!\n\nIf you want to **add a new column** with the transformed data, do:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs_new = vs + 1)\n```\n\nIf you want to use `across` for practice, here's the **correct way**:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\nThis will create a new column `vs_plus1` with the incremented values.\n\n**OR**, if you really want the new column to be named \"x\":\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\nBut this is not common, and if you do it with >1 column, you will get a name collision error.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary / Solution**\n\n**Best Practice:**\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs_plus1 = vs + 1)\n```\nor\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n**Remove the trailing comma** after `.names`, and make sure your `.names` is a template if you use `across()`. \n\n**Your major issue**: **Syntax error in `.names` and the trailing comma**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Correct Example**\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n---\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nIf you just need to update a single column, `mutate(vs = vs + 1)` is the idiomatic way in dplyr.

Let's clarify what's happening and your options.\n\n### What's Happening\n\n- `dplyr::closest` **does not exist** as a public/exported function.\n- If `closest()` works “as just closest” in your package, it’s probably because it's **internally created or imported somewhere else**, or comes from another dependency, or you (or a dependency) have defined it.\n- **dplyr does not export a function called `closest` as of dplyr 1.1.1+**.\n- Your linter and R CMD check are right: **you shouldn’t use unexported functions from other packages**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Double-check: where is `closest()` from?\n\n- Run `getAnywhere(closest)` or `where(\"closest\")` in your R session to see what `closest` actually points to.\n\n```r\ngetAnywhere(closest)\n```\n\nIf it lands in `dplyr` in a way like `<namespace:dplyr>`, it's internal and **not for external use**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. You Can't/Shouldn't Use Unexported Functions\n\n- **Unexported functions** (not in `NAMESPACE` with `export()` directive) are **not guaranteed to be stable or available**.\n- **DO NOT** use them in your package, as this will often break users if the dependency changes internals.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Options to Fix the Issue\n\n### a. **If you need that function, and it’s not exported:**\n- **Copy the code**: If it’s a simple utility, consider re-implementing or copying it into your own package, crediting the original if significant.\n- You can find the code with:\n  \n  ```r\n  dplyr:::closest\n  ```\n\n- **Or find an equivalent exported function**—usually, packages only guarantee exported APIs.\n\n### b. **Fix Linting/Build Issues**\n\n- **Remove usage of `dplyr:::closest`** or `closest` from your code.\n- If you must use closest-like logic, define your own, e.g., if it's a \"find closest value\" helper:\n\n  ```r\n  closest <- function(x, target) x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n  ```\n\n- **Do NOT do:** `dplyr:::closest()`. This is bad practice for CRAN-ready or robust code.\n\n### c. **Check Imports/Namespace**\n\n- If you wrote `importFrom(dplyr, closest)` in your `NAMESPACE` it's invalid and should be **removed**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why It Worked Sometimes\n\n- It could be because:\n    - You're in a session where something else defined `closest`\n    - You're loading an internal environment of dplyr (not recommended)\n    - You’re using `devtools::load_all()`, which sometimes makes internals available.\n\nThis is why it will fail in other contexts (like CRAN checks/other users’ computers).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| What you did    | Is It Supported? | Recommendation                                   |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `dplyr::closest()`  | ❌ NO            | Do not use; not exported                         |\n| `dplyr:::closest()` | ❌ NO            | Do not use in packages; internals may change      |\n| `closest()`        | ❓ Not unless defined elsewhere | Define it yourself or find a public function |\n| Copy the code    | ✅ YES           | If license allows; best for tiny utilities        |\n\n---\n\n## **References/Best Practices**\n\n- [R Packages: Imports](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#importing-objects)\n- [Hadley Wickham on Importing](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/6401#issuecomment-1288076490) (example issue about internals)\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary:**\n\n- **Do not use unexported functions from other packages in your own package.**\n- If you need similar behavior, re-implement it or copy with attribution.\n- Remove any `importFrom(dplyr, closest)` from your `NAMESPACE`.\n\n---\n\n**If you tell me what `closest` does for you, I can help you write a safe alternative!**"

                  "text": "You're facing a common situation in R package development: **using an unexported function from another package**. Let's clarify what's happening and your options.\n\n### What's Happening\n\n- `dplyr::closest` **does not exist** as a public/exported function.\n- If `closest()` works “as just closest” in your package, it’s probably because it's **internally created or imported somewhere else**, or comes from another dependency, or you (or a dependency) have defined it.\n- **dplyr does not export a function called `closest` as of dplyr 1.1.1+**.\n- Your linter and R CMD check are right: **you shouldn’t use unexported functions from other packages**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Double-check: where is `closest()` from?\n\n- Run `getAnywhere(closest)` or `where(\"closest\")` in your R session to see what `closest` actually points to.\n\n```r\ngetAnywhere(closest)\n```\n\nIf it lands in `dplyr` in a way like `<namespace:dplyr>`, it's internal and **not for external use**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. You Can't/Shouldn't Use Unexported Functions\n\n- **Unexported functions** (not in `NAMESPACE` with `export()` directive) are **not guaranteed to be stable or available**.\n- **DO NOT** use them in your package, as this will often break users if the dependency changes internals.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Options to Fix the Issue\n\n### a. **If you need that function, and it’s not exported:**\n- **Copy the code**: If it’s a simple utility, consider re-implementing or copying it into your own package, crediting the original if significant.\n- You can find the code with:\n  \n  ```r\n  dplyr:::closest\n  ```\n\n- **Or find an equivalent exported function**—usually, packages only guarantee exported APIs.\n\n### b. **Fix Linting/Build Issues**\n\n- **Remove usage of `dplyr:::closest`** or `closest` from your code.\n- If you must use closest-like logic, define your own, e.g., if it's a \"find closest value\" helper:\n\n  ```r\n  closest <- function(x, target) x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n  ```\n\n- **Do NOT do:** `dplyr:::closest()`. This is bad practice for CRAN-ready or robust code.\n\n### c. **Check Imports/Namespace**\n\n- If you wrote `importFrom(dplyr, closest)` in your `NAMESPACE` it's invalid and should be **removed**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why It Worked Sometimes\n\n- It could be because:\n    - You're in a session where something else defined `closest`\n    - You're loading an internal environment of dplyr (not recommended)\n    - You’re using `devtools::load_all()`, which sometimes makes internals available.\n\nThis is why it will fail in other contexts (like CRAN checks/other users’ computers).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| What you did    | Is It Supported? | Recommendation                                   |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `dplyr::closest()`  | ❌ NO            | Do not use; not exported                         |\n| `dplyr:::closest()` | ❌ NO            | Do not use in packages; internals may change      |\n| `closest()`        | ❓ Not unless defined elsewhere | Define it yourself or find a public function |\n| Copy the code    | ✅ YES           | If license allows; best for tiny utilities        |\n\n---\n\n## **References/Best Practices**\n\n- [R Packages: Imports](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#importing-objects)\n- [Hadley Wickham on Importing](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/6401#issuecomment-1288076490) (example issue about internals)\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary:**\n\n- **Do not use unexported functions from other packages in your own package.**\n- If you need similar behavior, re-implement it or copy with attribution.\n- Remove any `importFrom(dplyr, closest)` from your `NAMESPACE`.\n\n---\n\n**If you tell me what `closest` does for you, I can help you write a safe alternative!**",

However, `dplyr::closest()` fails because **`closest()` is *not* an exported function from dplyr**—it's an **internal function**.\n\nHere's what you should know and what you can do:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why does `closest()` work in your package?\n\n- If your package *Imports* `dplyr`, then `dplyr`'s namespace is *attached* when you run examples/tests, so unexported functions can often (though not always reliably) be found through the search path.\n- BUT: this is accidental and fragile — you shouldn’t rely on it, and robust linters/CRAN checks will rightfully complain.  \n- R CMD check will throw **\"no visible global function definition\"** warnings for this.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to handle use of **unexported function** `closest()`?\n\n### → **You should not directly use unexported/internal functions from other packages.**\n\n- dplyr authors can change, rename, or remove such functions at any time without warning.\n\n#### ➤ **Is there a public equivalent to dplyr's `closest()`?**\n\n- **No: There is no exported `closest()` function in dplyr.**\n  - It's used internally in `dplyr` for windowing/joining logic.\n  - It is not part of dplyr's API and not meant for package authors.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Recommended actions**\n\n### **A. Check if you really need `closest()`**\n\n- Are you sure you need its exact behavior?  \n- If it's, e.g., \"find the closest element in a sorted vector,\" search CRAN for a package that provides this, or write a simple function yourself.\n\n#### *Example replacement implementation:*\n\nSuppose you want, *given a numeric vector and a value, the index of the element closest to that value*:\n\n```r\nwhich_closest <- function(x, y) {\n  which.min(abs(x - y))\n}\n```\n\n- This is simple, robust, and under your control.\n\n### **B. If you must use the internal function** (not recommended):\n\nYou can technically access it like this:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest\n```\n- Note the *three* colons (`:::`).  \n- However, **CRAN strongly discourages using `:::` for non-exported functions** from other packages.  \n- It will trigger errors or warnings during package checks.\n\n### **C. Ask dplyr authors to export `closest()`, or copy the function**\n\n- You can raise an Issue with dplyr and ask if `closest()` can be exported, but unless there's a clear need for it, this is unlikely.\n- If you really must have *exactly* their version, and it's short/simple, you may copy-and-credit their function into your package, respecting their [licensing](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/LICENSE.md) (MIT).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Strategy                         | Syntax             | CRAN-safe?  | Recommended?                  |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| Use as `closest()`                | closest()          | ❌          | ❌ No (unclear provenance)     |\n| Use as `dplyr::closest()`         | dplyr::closest()   | ❌          | ❌ No (not exported)           |\n| Use as `dplyr:::closest()`        | dplyr:::closest()  | ❌          | ❌ No (private, will warn/fail)|\n| Copy source to your package       | your_own_closest() | ✅          | ✅ Yes, attribute credit       |\n| Use your own implementation       | which_closest()    | ✅          | ✅ Yes                         |\n\n---\n\n## **In summary**\n\n- **Do not use `dplyr::closest()` or rely on internal functions.**\n- **Write your own helper** or use a function from a package that explicitly exports it.\n- If you must, you can copy and credit the source from dplyr (respecting their license).\n\n---\n\n**Example replacement:**\n\n```r\nclosest <- function(x, y) {\n  # returns index of element in x closest to y\n  which.min(abs(x - y))\n}\n```\n\nOr search CRAN for a suitable package (e.g., `FNN::get.knnx` or similar) if you're working with nearest-neighbor logic.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n> **Never use non-exported functions from another package in your own package.**  \n> Write your own or ask the upstream maintainers to export it."
