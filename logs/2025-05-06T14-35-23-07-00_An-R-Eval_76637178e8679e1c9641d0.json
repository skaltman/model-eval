But the above does what you described for standard bar proportions.\n***\n[Criterion]: Preferably: \n\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count)), fill = clarity))\n```\n\nThe dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0, but it still works:\n\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = ..count.. / sum(..count..), fill = clarity))\n```\n\nSimply setting `position = \"fill\" will result in each bar having a height of 1 and is not correct.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer correctly implements the specified criteria for setting the flag:\n\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\" OR\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submission, there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the criteria. The submitted solution implements:\n- Checks for any \"Type_II\" AND\n- Checks for Type_I visits that are ≥90 days apart\n\nThis is incorrect in two important ways:\n1. The criteria use OR logic between the two conditions, but the submission uses AND logic (`has_type_ii & has_type_i_90d_apart`)\n2. The criteria specify Type_I entries within 90 days of each other, but the code checks for entries that are at least 90 days apart (which is the opposite)\n\nAdditionally, the code comment itself misinterprets the requirements:\n> There is at least one instance of \"Type_II\" and\n> There are at least two \"Type_I\" visits that are ≥90 days apart\n\nThe expected criterion solution correctly:\n- Uses OR logic (`any(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`)\n- Checks for Type_I entries within 90 days of each other (`diff(...) <= 90`)\n\nThe submission's approach is relatively sophisticated using outer matrices and pairwise differences, but implements the wrong logic. Since the final results will be significantly wrong due to these logical errors, this must be considered incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I",

You want to create a logical flag **per ID** if:\n\n1. There is at least **one instance** of `\"Type_II\"` **and**\n2. There are **at least two `\"Type_I\"` visits that are ≥90 days apart**\n\nHere’s **how to do this with tidyverse** (`dplyr` and `tidyr`):\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-step Solution**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # Get all Type_I dates for each ID\n    type_i_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    has_type_i_90d_apart = purrr::map_lgl(type_i_dates, function(dates) {\n      # At least 2 Type_I visits required\n      if (length(dates) < 2) return(FALSE)\n      # Compute all pairwise differences\n      mat <- abs(outer(dates, dates, \"-\"))\n      # Exclude diagonal (0 difference), check if any >= 90\n      any(mat[upper.tri(mat)] >= 90)\n    }),\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_type_i_90d_apart)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **How this works:**\n- For each ID, find if `\"Type_II\"` is present (**`any(type == \"Type_II\")`**).\n- For each ID, get dates where `type == \"Type_I\"`.\n- Using a little **purrr/map** magic, for each list of dates, use `outer` to get **all unique pairwise day differences**, and check if **any are 90 or more days apart**.\n- The `Flag` is `1` if **both conditions** are met, else `0`.\n\n---\n\n### **Output:**\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need it as base R or a different style!**\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submission, there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the criteria. The submitted solution implements:\n- Checks for any \"Type_II\" AND\n- Checks for Type_I visits that are ≥90 days apart\n\nThis is incorrect in two important ways:\n1. The criteria use OR logic between the two conditions, but the submission uses AND logic (`has_type_ii & has_type_i_90d_apart`)\n2. The criteria specify Type_I entries within 90 days of each other, but the code checks for entries that are at least 90 days apart (which is the opposite)\n\nAdditionally, the code comment itself misinterprets the requirements:\n> There is at least one instance of \"Type_II\" and\n> There are at least two \"Type_I\" visits that are ≥90 days apart\n\nThe expected criterion solution correctly:\n- Uses OR logic (`any(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`)\n- Checks for Type_I entries within 90 days of each other (`diff(...) <= 90`)\n\nThe submission's approach is relatively sophisticated using outer matrices and pairwise differences, but implements the wrong logic. Since the final results will be significantly wrong due to these logical errors, this must be considered incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I"

The submission is checking for Type_I cases that are *at least* 90 days apart (meaning greater than or equal to 90 days), when it should be checking for Type_I cases that are *within* 90 days of each other (less than or equal to 90 days).\n\nThis is evident in both solutions provided:\n- In the first solution: `any(outer(...)) >= 90`\n- In the second solution: `any(abs(outer(...)) >= 90`\n\nThese are checking for cases where the difference is at least 90 days, not within 90 days.\n\nThe criterion solution correctly implements this with:\n`any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`\n\nThis checks if any consecutive dates of Type_I are within 90 days of each other.\n\nAdditionally, there's a logical issue. The criterion uses OR (`|`) between the two conditions while the submission uses AND (`&`). This means the criterion flags an ID if EITHER condition is met, while the submission requires BOTH conditions to be met.\n\nThis difference would lead to different results for some IDs, making the submission incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission based on the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly addresses the key requirements:\n\n1. **Grouping by origin**: The code properly arranges by origin and time, then uses `group_by(origin)` before applying the lag function, ensuring that delays are only compared within the same airport.\n\n2. **Using lag() for previous flight's delay**: The code uses `lag(dep_delay)` to capture the previous flight's delay within each origin group.\n\n3. **Proper filtering of NA values**: The submission filters out rows where either the current or previous delay is NA using `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))`.\n\n4. **Calculating mean delay by previous delay**: The code groups by binned previous delay values and calculates the mean delay for the current flights, which satisfies the requirement to visualize the mean departure delay vs. the previous flight's delay.\n\n5. **Visualization**: The submission includes code to plot the relationship as required.\n\nThe approach of binning the previous departure delays is actually beneficial for better visualization with large datasets, though the criterion indicates that summarizing by the exact numeric delay values would also be acceptable.\n\nThe code is well-structured, clearly explained, and would produce an appropriate visualization of the temporal correlation in flight delays.

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Certainly! You want to **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight vs. the delay of the preceding flight** using the `flights` data. \n\nYou'll use **`dplyr`** for data manipulation, **`lag()`** to get preceding delays, and **`ggplot2`** to visualize.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

You want to **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight vs. the delay of the preceding flight** using the `flights` data. \n\nYou'll use **`dplyr`** for data manipulation, **`lag()`** to get preceding delays, and **`ggplot2`** to visualize.

                  "text": "Certainly! You want to **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight vs. the delay of the preceding flight** using the `flights` data. \n\nYou'll use **`dplyr`** for data manipulation, **`lag()`** to get preceding delays, and **`ggplot2`** to visualize. Here’s a full tidyverse solution:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13) # for the flights dataset if you haven't loaded it yet\n\n# Step 1: Sort flights by time (origin is necessary since each airport has its own schedule)\nflights_lag <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%   # dep_delay of previous flight at same origin\n  ungroup()\n\n# Step 2: Remove entries with missing values (for dep_delay or previous dep_delay)\nflights_lag_clean <- flights_lag %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n\n# Step 3: Bin previous delays to reduce overplotting, and compute mean current delay\nflights_binned <- flights_lag_clean %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut_width(prev_dep_delay, width = 10, boundary = 0)) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_prev_dep_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay),\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),\n    n = n()\n  )\n\n# Step 4: Plot\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = mean_prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n), color = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"firebrick\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean departure delay vs. departure delay of preceding flight\",\n    x = \"Mean dep_delay of preceding flight (minutes, binned)\",\n    y = \"Mean dep_delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n    size = \"Flights per bin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- This code bins the previous delays into 10-minute bins (change this as you wish).\n- Points' size shows how many flights per bin.\n- `geom_smooth()` adds a trend line.\n- You can omit the binning step if you want a scatterplot of every point, but it will be very dense.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a pure scatterplot without binning:\n\n```r\nggplot(flights_lag_clean, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 60) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"dep_delay of a flight vs. dep_delay of the previous flight\",\n    x = \"Previous flight dep_delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Current flight dep_delay (minutes)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n`geom_hex()` helps with overplotting when there are lots of points.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `lag()` after `arrange(origin, dep_time)`\n- Plot `dep_delay` vs `prev_dep_delay`\n- Optionally, bin for smoothness or use `geom_hex()` for density\n\nLet me know if you'd like the output for a specific origin, or for all flights together!",

      "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Instead, it directly plots all individual points (in the first plot as a hex bin, in the second plot as points with a smoothing line).\n\nThe criterion specifically asks for \"mean departure delay of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\" This requires calculating means for each lagged delay value (which the example code in the criterion does with `.by = dep_delay_lag`).\n\nWhile the submission code produces visualizations that show patterns between lagged delays and current delays, it doesn't specifically calculate and plot the mean values as required.

This assumes that \"immediately preceding flight\" means the last flight out of a given airport on the same day.\n\nHere's how you can do this in the tidyverse:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Bin previous delays for nicer plotting, optional:\n  # mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 60) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Dep Delay vs Previous Flight's Dep Delay (All NYC airports, same day)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **group_by(origin, year, month, day):** For each airport on each day.\n- **arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE):** Orders the flights in time.\n- **mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)):** Adds the previous flight's dep_delay (within group).\n- **filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)):** Removes missing data (first flight of day, or any NAs).\n- **ggplot:** Plots each flight's delay vs the previous flight's delay (hex bin plot handles overplotting).\n\n#### Alternative: Use `stat_smooth` for trend\nIf you want to see the trend/relationship directly, use a scatterplot with a smoother:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"gam\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    y = \"This flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Mean dep_delay vs previous flight's dep_delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis will clearly visualize the temporal correlation in delays.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This assumes that \"immediately preceding flight\" means the last flight out of a given airport on the same day.\n\nHere's how you can do this in the tidyverse:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Bin previous delays for nicer plotting, optional:\n  # mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 60) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Dep Delay vs Previous Flight's Dep Delay (All NYC airports, same day)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **group_by(origin, year, month, day):** For each airport on each day.\n- **arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE):** Orders the flights in time.\n- **mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)):** Adds the previous flight's dep_delay (within group).\n- **filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)):** Removes missing data (first flight of day, or any NAs).\n- **ggplot:** Plots each flight's delay vs the previous flight's delay (hex bin plot handles overplotting).\n\n#### Alternative: Use `stat_smooth` for trend\nIf you want to see the trend/relationship directly, use a scatterplot with a smoother:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  arrange(sched_dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"gam\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    y = \"This flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Mean dep_delay vs previous flight's dep_delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis will clearly visualize the temporal correlation in delays."

Option 2: Use GET with Query Parameters - In this solution, they do not explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")` in the code example.\n\nSince GET is the default method in httr2, it's not strictly required to explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")`. However, if we're strictly evaluating against the criterion that there should be an explicit `req_method(\"GET\")` in the code, then this is indeed missing from the second solution option.\n\nThe submission provides correct and helpful answers overall, but it lacks the explicit `req_method(\"GET\")` statement in the GET solution that the criterion is specifically looking for.\n\nGRADE: P"

The **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed** error means that you're making a request using an HTTP method that the server does **not** support for that endpoint.\n\n### What's wrong with your `curl` and R code?\n\nYou are using `-X 'GET'` (or `method = \"GET\"` in R) **together with a request body** (`-d '{...}'`), which is almost always **incorrect**.  \n- **GET** requests should **not have a body** (by HTTP standard and by convention).  \n- Most web servers will reject a GET with a body, which is exactly what's happening — thus, 405 error.\n\n### What should you do?\n\n#### 1. **If the API really expects a body, use POST (or PUT/PATCH)**\n\n```sh\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\nAnd in R (using httr2):\n\n```r\none2<- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type`= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\" )\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n**Change GET to POST**.\n\n#### 2. **If the API only supports GET, send parameters in the URL (as query parameters)**\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\ncurl -X GET \\\n  'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nAnd in R:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **405 error:** You're using GET _with a body_.\n- Change your **method to POST** (if a body is needed).\n- Or **send parameters as query** if the API only wants GET.\n\n---\n\n**Check the API documentation** to confirm which HTTP method should be used, and where to put your parameters.\n\nIf you still get a 405 after using POST, check if you're using the right endpoint, and if the server expects different parameters or headers!"

In fact, the submission correctly points out that httr2 uses GET by default, stating: \"The default method for `httr2::request` is GET.\" \n\nThe submission actually suggests that the problem is not a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` but rather that:\n1. The request should probably be changed to POST (Option 1)\n2. Or if it should remain GET, the parameters should be in the URL querystring, not the body (Option 2)\n\nThis is accurate - in httr2, the GET method is already the default, so there's no \"missing\" `req_method(\"GET\")`. The real issue is the mismatch between using a GET method with a request body.\n\nSince the submission correctly identifies that there is NOT a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` (because GET is the default), and correctly diagnoses the actual problem, it meets the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

You're sending a body with a GET method**\n- Both in curl and in R/httr2, you're sending a JSON body **with a GET** request.\n- Most APIs (and many HTTP libraries) do **not allow** this.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix**\n\n### **Option 1: Use POST instead**\n\nIf the API expects you to send those parameters in the JSON body, **it is almost certainly expecting a POST** (or sometimes PUT/PATCH).\n\n**Curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n**R / httr2:**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n      list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  ) %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\")  # <----- ADD THIS LINE\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n**Note:** The default method for `httr2::request` is GET. You must set it to POST.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Use GET properly (with querystring, not body)**\n\nIf the API is expecting a GET request **with parameters in the URL (query parameters)**, you should **not send a body**, but provide the parameters on the URL.\n\n**Curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n  'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\n**R / httr2:**\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\none2 <- request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n     id = 4,\n     fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n     fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n**No body for GET!**\n\n---\n\n## **Which option is correct?**\n\n- **Check your API documentation**: If you do not control the endpoint, check if the parameters should go in the body (POST/PUT), or as query parameters (GET).\n- **405 errors** often mean you used the wrong HTTP verb. Most likely, you need to change to POST.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Parameter Location | HTTP Method | How to Send in Curl | httr2 Code                  |\n|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Querystring (URL)  | GET         | `?id=...&fecha=...` | `req_url_query()`           |\n| JSON Body          | POST        | `-X POST -d '{...}'`| `req_body_json(...) %>% req_method(\"POST\")` |\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n**You probably need to change the request to `POST`.**  \nIf not, move your parameters to the URL, remove the body, and keep using `GET`.\n\nIf you need more help, **provide your API's docs** and I'll help tailor an exact solution!\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In fact, the submission correctly points out that httr2 uses GET by default, stating: \"The default method for `httr2::request` is GET.\" \n\nThe submission actually suggests that the problem is not a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` but rather that:\n1. The request should probably be changed to POST (Option 1)\n2. Or if it should remain GET, the parameters should be in the URL querystring, not the body (Option 2)\n\nThis is accurate - in httr2, the GET method is already the default, so there's no \"missing\" `req_method(\"GET\")`. The real issue is the mismatch between using a GET method with a request body.\n\nSince the submission correctly identifies that there is NOT a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` (because GET is the default), and correctly diagnoses the actual problem, it meets the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

You must set it to POST.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Use GET properly (with querystring, not body)**\n\nIf the API is expecting a GET request **with parameters in the URL (query parameters)**, you should **not send a body**, but provide the parameters on the URL.\n\n**Curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n  'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\n**R / httr2:**\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\none2 <- request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n     id = 4,\n     fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n     fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n**No body for GET!**\n\n---\n\n## **Which option is correct?**\n\n- **Check your API documentation**: If you do not control the endpoint, check if the parameters should go in the body (POST/PUT), or as query parameters (GET).\n- **405 errors** often mean you used the wrong HTTP verb. Most likely, you need to change to POST.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Parameter Location | HTTP Method | How to Send in Curl | httr2 Code                  |\n|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Querystring (URL)  | GET         | `?id=...&fecha=...` | `req_url_query()`           |\n| JSON Body          | POST        | `-X POST -d '{...}'`| `req_body_json(...) %>% req_method(\"POST\")` |\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n**You probably need to change the request to `POST`.**  \nIf not, move your parameters to the URL, remove the body, and keep using `GET`.\n\nIf you need more help, **provide your API's docs** and I'll help tailor an exact solution!",

The request should probably be changed to POST (Option 1)\n2. Or if it should remain GET, the parameters should be in the URL querystring, not the body (Option 2)\n\nThis is accurate - in httr2, the GET method is already the default, so there's no \"missing\" `req_method(\"GET\")`. The real issue is the mismatch between using a GET method with a request body.\n\nSince the submission correctly identifies that there is NOT a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` (because GET is the default), and correctly diagnoses the actual problem, it meets the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

You can generalize this to add `NA` rows for any unused level in your factor.\n\n---\n\n#### **Bonus: Generalize for ALL unused levels**\n\n```r\nunused_levels <- setdiff(levels(df$z), df$z)\ndf_legend <- data.frame(\n  x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(unused_levels, levels = levels(df$z))\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = df_legend, aes(x, y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**This approach is robust for any number of unused levels.**\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

You can generalize this to add `NA` rows for any unused level in your factor.\n\n---\n\n#### **Bonus: Generalize for ALL unused levels**\n\n```r\nunused_levels <- setdiff(levels(df$z), df$z)\ndf_legend <- data.frame(\n  x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(unused_levels, levels = levels(df$z))\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = df_legend, aes(x, y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**This approach is robust for any number of unused levels.**",

                  "text": "You're encountering a well-known limitation in **ggplot2**: when a level of a factor is *unused* (i.e., not present in the data), the default legend key for that unused level will appear blank if you use `geom_point()`—the legend key is just empty space, not a colored dot.\n\nThis is because `geom_point()` draws legend keys only for the groups *present in the data*, so for unused levels, `ggplot2` displays the label but does not draw a point.\n\n## How to show colored dots for unused levels?\n\nThe **trick** is to **manually override the legend appearance** using the `override.aes` argument in `guides()`. You can tell ggplot2 to always draw a dot in the legend, e.g., by setting `shape`, `fill`, and especially `alpha = 1` for all legend entries.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    color = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(alpha = 1, shape = 16) # ensures dots for unused levels\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n**Key point:**\n- `override.aes = list(alpha = 1, shape = 16)` tells ggplot to draw the dots for all legend entries, including the unused one (`d`), with a point (shape 16) and fully opaque (alpha = 1).\n- If your points are a different shape or size, match those in `override.aes`.\n\nThis will **show colored dots for all levels of your factor**, whether or not they are present in the data!\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [ggplot2 legend for unused factor levels](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2646)  \n- [Customizing ggplot2 legends](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guide_legend.html)  \n- [Stack Overflow: Legend keys for unused factors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55909888/ggplot2-unused-level-has-blank-legend-key/55911725#55911725)",

This is safer and easier.\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nresp <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") |> \n  req_url_query(\n    q = address,\n    api_key = api_key\n  ) |>\n  req_perform()\n```\nThis way, **all necessary encoding is handled for you**.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n- **Do not** directly insert unencoded user input in URLs.\n- **Either**: use `URLencode()` on variable parts,\n- **Or (better)**: let your HTTP library build the URL and queries with proper encoding.\n\n---\n\n**Your error will go away if you use either fix above!**  \nIf you want to extract the geocoding result, you can add:\n\n```r\njson <- resp %>% resp_body_json()\nprint(json)\n```\n\nLet me know if you need details on parsing or using the results!",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for making discrete named breaks work as labels by default in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion states two specific changes:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission proposes a different approach. Instead of the specific changes in the criterion, it adds a large code block to detect named breaks and set labels accordingly. This code section:\n\n```r\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    breaks <- self$breaks\n    # If breaks is a function, try to evaluate with scale limits\n    if (is.function(breaks)) {\n      breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n    } else {\n      breaks_vals <- breaks\n    }\n    if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission attempts to solve the problem of using named breaks as labels, it does not implement the specific code changes required by the criterion. The solution is more complex than needed and doesn't preserve the names through the mapping functions as required.\n\nThe criterion specifies two precise, minimal changes that would ensure names are preserved when breaks are retrieved and mapped, which is more direct than the proposed approach.\n\nGRADE: I",

To make `sec_axis` and `dup_axis` automatically use **the names of discrete breaks as labels** if the breaks vector has names (the same behavior as primary axes), you need to adjust where the default labels are derived.\n\nCurrently, `AxisSecondary$init()` has this line:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nBut this does **not** handle the case where discrete breaks have names but `labels` is left as `waiver()` or `derive()`.\n\nFurthermore, when the **primary axis** receives a named vector for breaks, `scale_get_labels()` uses those names as labels (unless otherwise specified). Your proposal is to replicate this behavior for secondary axes.\n\n## What To Edit\n\n1. **Update AxisSecondary$init()** so that, for **discrete** secondary axes, if no labels are supplied, but breaks have names, the named breaks' names will be used as labels.\n\n## How To Do It\n\nInsert logic in the `init` method so that:\n\n- For discrete axes, if labels are not specified (still `waiver()` or `derive()`), and breaks are not `waiver()`, **and** breaks have names, set `labels` to `names(breaks)`.\n\nHere’s a code snippet for the change:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ## <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< INSERT HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Allow breaks as function: evaluate with palette levels\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- This logic must come **before** this line:  \n  ```r\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  ```\n  so that derived labels from break names take priority only when `labels` is not otherwise supplied.\n\n- For safety, you handle the case where `breaks` could be a function (as with `get_breaks()` in ggplot2), so you try to evaluate it before checking for names.\n\n- You only assign labels if at least one name is nonempty.\n\n## Full Diff/Insertion\n\n**Replace the relevant section of `AxisSecondary$init` with the following:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # If breaks is a function, try to evaluate with scale limits\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAdd this logic into `AxisSecondary$init()` as shown, right before `if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels`, and it will ensure that secondary discrete axes use the names of breaks as the default labels.\n\n---\n\n**If you’d like a complete ready-to-paste block, let me know!**\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission proposes a different approach.

To make `sec_axis` and `dup_axis` automatically use **the names of discrete breaks as labels** if the breaks vector has names (the same behavior as primary axes), you need to adjust where the default labels are derived.\n\nCurrently, `AxisSecondary$init()` has this line:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nBut this does **not** handle the case where discrete breaks have names but `labels` is left as `waiver()` or `derive()`.\n\nFurthermore, when the **primary axis** receives a named vector for breaks, `scale_get_labels()` uses those names as labels (unless otherwise specified). Your proposal is to replicate this behavior for secondary axes.\n\n## What To Edit\n\n1. **Update AxisSecondary$init()** so that, for **discrete** secondary axes, if no labels are supplied, but breaks have names, the named breaks' names will be used as labels.\n\n## How To Do It\n\nInsert logic in the `init` method so that:\n\n- For discrete axes, if labels are not specified (still `waiver()` or `derive()`), and breaks are not `waiver()`, **and** breaks have names, set `labels` to `names(breaks)`.\n\nHere’s a code snippet for the change:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ## <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< INSERT HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Allow breaks as function: evaluate with palette levels\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- This logic must come **before** this line:  \n  ```r\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  ```\n  so that derived labels from break names take priority only when `labels` is not otherwise supplied.\n\n- For safety, you handle the case where `breaks` could be a function (as with `get_breaks()` in ggplot2), so you try to evaluate it before checking for names.\n\n- You only assign labels if at least one name is nonempty.\n\n## Full Diff/Insertion\n\n**Replace the relevant section of `AxisSecondary$init` with the following:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # If breaks is a function, try to evaluate with scale limits\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAdd this logic into `AxisSecondary$init()` as shown, right before `if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels`, and it will ensure that secondary discrete axes use the names of breaks as the default labels.\n\n---\n\n**If you’d like a complete ready-to-paste block, let me know!**"

Your proposal is to replicate this behavior for secondary axes.\n\n## What To Edit\n\n1. **Update AxisSecondary$init()** so that, for **discrete** secondary axes, if no labels are supplied, but breaks have names, the named breaks' names will be used as labels.\n\n## How To Do It\n\nInsert logic in the `init` method so that:\n\n- For discrete axes, if labels are not specified (still `waiver()` or `derive()`), and breaks are not `waiver()`, **and** breaks have names, set `labels` to `names(breaks)`.\n\nHere’s a code snippet for the change:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ## <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< INSERT HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Allow breaks as function: evaluate with palette levels\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- This logic must come **before** this line:  \n  ```r\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  ```\n  so that derived labels from break names take priority only when `labels` is not otherwise supplied.\n\n- For safety, you handle the case where `breaks` could be a function (as with `get_breaks()` in ggplot2), so you try to evaluate it before checking for names.\n\n- You only assign labels if at least one name is nonempty.\n\n## Full Diff/Insertion\n\n**Replace the relevant section of `AxisSecondary$init` with the following:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n    if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # If breaks is a function, try to evaluate with scale limits\n      if (is.function(breaks)) {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n      } else {\n        breaks_vals <- breaks\n      }\n      if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAdd this logic into `AxisSecondary$init()` as shown, right before `if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels`, and it will ensure that secondary discrete axes use the names of breaks as the default labels.\n\n---\n\n**If you’d like a complete ready-to-paste block, let me know!**",

This code section:\n\n```r\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  # If labels are not supplied and breaks are named, use names as labels\n  if ((is.derived(self$labels) || is.waiver(self$labels)) && !is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    breaks <- self$breaks\n    # If breaks is a function, try to evaluate with scale limits\n    if (is.function(breaks)) {\n      breaks_vals <- breaks(scale$get_limits())\n    } else {\n      breaks_vals <- breaks\n    }\n    if (!is.null(names(breaks_vals)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks_vals)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(breaks_vals)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission attempts to solve the problem of using named breaks as labels, it does not implement the specific code changes required by the criterion. The solution is more complex than needed and doesn't preserve the names through the mapping functions as required.\n\nThe criterion specifies two precise, minimal changes that would ensure names are preserved when breaks are retrieved and mapped, which is more direct than the proposed approach.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for properly handling named breaks in discrete scales for secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n\n1. Adding `setNames()` to preserve names from the primary axis breaks when getting breaks for discrete scales.\n2. Adding `setNames()` to preserve break names when mapping values in the `break_info()` function.\n\nThe submission's solution is different. Instead of directly preserving names during the breaks collection and mapping, it adds a new code block after breaks are determined, checking if:\n- The scale is discrete\n- The labels are either waiver() or derive()\n- The breaks have non-null, non-empty names\n\nIf these conditions are met, it sets labels to the break names.\n\nWhile this alternative approach would likely work in many cases, it fails to properly handle the core requirement - preserving the names during the breaks processing. The crucial issue is that the submission doesn't modify how names are preserved during the `scale$map(self$breaks)` call, which is specifically identified in the criterion as needing to be wrapped with `setNames()`.\n\nThe submission's approach is more complex and addresses the symptom (needing named breaks as labels) rather than the cause (preserving names during processing). The criterion's solution directly fixes the issue at its source by ensuring names are consistently preserved throughout the process.\n\nGRADE: P",

Adding `setNames()` to preserve names from the primary axis breaks when getting breaks for discrete scales.\n2. Adding `setNames()` to preserve break names when mapping values in the `break_info()` function.\n\nThe submission's solution is different. Instead of directly preserving names during the breaks collection and mapping, it adds a new code block after breaks are determined, checking if:\n- The scale is discrete\n- The labels are either waiver() or derive()\n- The breaks have non-null, non-empty names\n\nIf these conditions are met, it sets labels to the break names.\n\nWhile this alternative approach would likely work in many cases, it fails to properly handle the core requirement - preserving the names during the breaks processing. The crucial issue is that the submission doesn't modify how names are preserved during the `scale$map(self$breaks)` call, which is specifically identified in the criterion as needing to be wrapped with `setNames()`.\n\nThe submission's approach is more complex and addresses the symptom (needing named breaks as labels) rather than the cause (preserving names during processing). The criterion's solution directly fixes the issue at its source by ensuring names are consistently preserved throughout the process.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly implements the requested changes according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes needed:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission does not implement either of these changes. Instead, it proposes a different approach by adding new code that tries to use the names of breaks as labels for discrete secondary axes. While this might achieve a similar end result, it doesn't follow the specific implementation required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission adds new code after the existing labels assignment, rather than modifying the specific lines mentioned in the criterion. The approach is more complex, involving conditional logic to check if breaks is a named vector and then setting a function to labels.\n\nWhile the proposed solution might work functionally to display named breaks as labels, it doesn't match the specific changes required by the criterion, which involve preserving names through the mapping process in two specific locations.\n\nGRADE: I",

However, if the vector of breaks you pass to the secondary axis has names (i.e., `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)`), you often want those names used as axis labels by default—just like in (some) primary axis implementations.\n\n**Goal:**  \nFor discrete scales, by default, **if `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is not explicitly set**, then axis labels should be the names of `breaks`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n1. **In `AxisSecondary$init()`:**  \n   When initializing, after resolving `self$breaks` and `self$labels`, add logic for discrete axes where:\n    - If discrete,\n    - If `breaks` is a named vector (i.e., `!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))`)\n    - And if `labels` is \"derived\" or a `waiver()`\n    - Then set `labels` to those names\n\n2. **Justification:**  \n   - The logic should occur after the default assignment of `self$breaks` and `self$labels` in `init()`, so it can fill in `labels` only when needed.\n   - This **will not override labels if user provides them**.\n   - Only does this for discrete axes.\n\n---\n\n## SUGGESTED PATCH\n\nAdd this in your `AxisSecondary$init = function(self, scale) { ... }` **just after** assigning `self$labels` (after  \n`if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels` and `if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide`):\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Defensive: allow for function-valued breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        # If labels wasn't explicitly set\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          n <- names(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) {\n            # Return names for matching values\n            setNames(rep(NA_character_, length(x)), NULL) |>\n              replace(seq_along(x), n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)], n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)]) %>%\n              {.[seq_along(x)]} # Ensure return value is same length/ordering as `x`\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nIf you want something more concise (and are sure your breaks really will be numeric or character vectors), you can simplify:\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          nms <- names(breaks)\n          vals <- unname(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) nms[match(x, vals)]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**(If you want to replicate ggplot2 behavior fully, use the simpler version above.)**\n\n## **Where exactly to insert**\n\nAfter this existing code in your `init = function(self, scale) { ... }`:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    ...

However, if the vector of breaks you pass to the secondary axis has names (i.e., `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)`), you often want those names used as axis labels by default—just like in (some) primary axis implementations.\n\n**Goal:**  \nFor discrete scales, by default, **if `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is not explicitly set**, then axis labels should be the names of `breaks`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n1. **In `AxisSecondary$init()`:**  \n   When initializing, after resolving `self$breaks` and `self$labels`, add logic for discrete axes where:\n    - If discrete,\n    - If `breaks` is a named vector (i.e., `!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))`)\n    - And if `labels` is \"derived\" or a `waiver()`\n    - Then set `labels` to those names\n\n2. **Justification:**  \n   - The logic should occur after the default assignment of `self$breaks` and `self$labels` in `init()`, so it can fill in `labels` only when needed.\n   - This **will not override labels if user provides them**.\n   - Only does this for discrete axes.\n\n---\n\n## SUGGESTED PATCH\n\nAdd this in your `AxisSecondary$init = function(self, scale) { ... }` **just after** assigning `self$labels` (after  \n`if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels` and `if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide`):\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Defensive: allow for function-valued breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        # If labels wasn't explicitly set\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          n <- names(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) {\n            # Return names for matching values\n            setNames(rep(NA_character_, length(x)), NULL) |>\n              replace(seq_along(x), n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)], n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)]) %>%\n              {.[seq_along(x)]} # Ensure return value is same length/ordering as `x`\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nIf you want something more concise (and are sure your breaks really will be numeric or character vectors), you can simplify:\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          nms <- names(breaks)\n          vals <- unname(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) nms[match(x, vals)]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**(If you want to replicate ggplot2 behavior fully, use the simpler version above.)**\n\n## **Where exactly to insert**\n\nAfter this existing code in your `init = function(self, scale) { ... }`:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    ...

However, if the vector of breaks you pass to the secondary axis has names (i.e., `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)`), you often want those names used as axis labels by default—just like in (some) primary axis implementations.\n\n**Goal:**  \nFor discrete scales, by default, **if `breaks` is a named vector and `labels` is not explicitly set**, then axis labels should be the names of `breaks`.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n1. **In `AxisSecondary$init()`:**  \n   When initializing, after resolving `self$breaks` and `self$labels`, add logic for discrete axes where:\n    - If discrete,\n    - If `breaks` is a named vector (i.e., `!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))`)\n    - And if `labels` is \"derived\" or a `waiver()`\n    - Then set `labels` to those names\n\n2. **Justification:**  \n   - The logic should occur after the default assignment of `self$breaks` and `self$labels` in `init()`, so it can fill in `labels` only when needed.\n   - This **will not override labels if user provides them**.\n   - Only does this for discrete axes.\n\n---\n\n## SUGGESTED PATCH\n\nAdd this in your `AxisSecondary$init = function(self, scale) { ... }` **just after** assigning `self$labels` (after  \n`if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels` and `if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide`):\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      # Defensive: allow for function-valued breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        # If labels wasn't explicitly set\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          n <- names(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) {\n            # Return names for matching values\n            setNames(rep(NA_character_, length(x)), NULL) |>\n              replace(seq_along(x), n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)], n[match(x, unname(breaks), nomatch = 0)]) %>%\n              {.[seq_along(x)]} # Ensure return value is same length/ordering as `x`\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nIf you want something more concise (and are sure your breaks really will be numeric or character vectors), you can simplify:\n\n```r\n    # Use names(breaks) as labels for discrete secondary axes, if labels not set\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      breaks <- self$breaks\n      if (is.atomic(breaks) && !is.null(names(breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(breaks)))) {\n        if (is.waiver(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          nms <- names(breaks)\n          vals <- unname(breaks)\n          self$labels <- function(x) nms[match(x, vals)]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**(If you want to replicate ggplot2 behavior fully, use the simpler version above.)**\n\n## **Where exactly to insert**\n\nAfter this existing code in your `init = function(self, scale) { ... }`:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    ...

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe submission proposes a solution using these steps:\n1. Group by `tailnum`\n2. Summarize to compute the count of flights, count of NA arr_delays, and proportion of NA arr_delays\n3. Filter to only include planes with at least 100 flights\n4. Arrange in descending order by proportion of NAs\n5. Take the first row to get the plane with the highest proportion\n\nLooking at the criterion, there's a key issue with the approach. The criterion specifically states that step 1 should be \"A grouped filter: only keep rows in flights that have > 100 rows.\" The submission does this filtering AFTER summarization, not before.\n\nThe correct approach per the criterion is:\n1. First filter to only include `tailnum`s with more than 100 flights\n2. Then calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays\n3. Finally arrange in descending order\n\nThe submission's approach produces the correct answer but uses a different methodology than what's specified in the criterion. It filters after summarizing, while the criterion wants filtering before summarizing.\n\nAdditionally, the submission uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/n_flights` to calculate the proportion, while the criterion specifically mentions using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` which is more concise.\n\nSince the submission gets the correct outcome but uses a different approach than what's required in the criterion, I would classify it as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

Arrange in descending order by proportion of NAs\n5. Take the first row to get the plane with the highest proportion\n\nLooking at the criterion, there's a key issue with the approach. The criterion specifically states that step 1 should be \"A grouped filter: only keep rows in flights that have > 100 rows.\" The submission does this filtering AFTER summarization, not before.\n\nThe correct approach per the criterion is:\n1. First filter to only include `tailnum`s with more than 100 flights\n2. Then calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays\n3. Finally arrange in descending order\n\nThe submission's approach produces the correct answer but uses a different methodology than what's specified in the criterion. It filters after summarizing, while the criterion wants filtering before summarizing.\n\nAdditionally, the submission uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/n_flights` to calculate the proportion, while the criterion specifically mentions using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` which is more concise.\n\nSince the submission gets the correct outcome but uses a different approach than what's required in the criterion, I would classify it as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P"

Here’s how you can **find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s,** _restricted to planes with at least 100 flights_, using the tidyverse:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delay / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n- Groups by `tailnum`.\n- Counts total flights and number of NA `arr_delay` for each `tailnum`.\n- Calculates the proportion of NA `arr_delay`.\n- Keeps only `tailnum` values with at least 100 flights.\n- Orders by the proportion of NA in descending order.\n- Returns the one with the highest proportion.\n\n**The resulting row contains the `tailnum` you asked for!**"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion outlines three main steps:\n1. Filter for `tailnum`s with more than 100 flights\n2. Calculate the proportion of NA values in `arr_delay` using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange in descending order to find the highest proportion\n\nLet's analyze the submission:\n\nThe code in the submission uses:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delay / n\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, n, na_arr_delay)\n```\n\nIssues with this approach:\n- It calculates the count (`n = n()`) and then filters (`filter(n >= 100)`) after summarizing, rather than filtering during the grouping step as specified in the criterion\n- It uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n` instead of directly using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as specified\n- The filtering is for `n >= 100` rather than `n > 100` as specified\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct final result (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA values), it doesn't follow the methodology outlined in the criterion. The approach is different from what was expected.\n\nGRADE: P",

To solve this, you need to:\n\n1. **Group by `tailnum`** in `flights`.\n2. **Count the number of flights per tailnum.**\n3. **Count the number of flights with `NA` in `arr_delay` per tailnum.**\n4. **Filter tailnums with at least 100 flights.**\n5. **Compute the proportion of NAs for each tailnum.**\n6. **Find the tailnum with the max proportion of NA.**\n\nHere’s the tidyverse code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delay / n\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, n, na_arr_delay)\n```\n\nThis will give you the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of `NA` values in `arr_delay` among those that have flown at least 100 flights, along with the proportion, count and number of NAs.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Filter for `tailnum`s with more than 100 flights\n2. Calculate the proportion of NA values in `arr_delay` using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange in descending order to find the highest proportion\n\nLet's analyze the submission:\n\nThe code in the submission uses:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delay / n\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, n, na_arr_delay)\n```\n\nIssues with this approach:\n- It calculates the count (`n = n()`) and then filters (`filter(n >= 100)`) after summarizing, rather than filtering during the grouping step as specified in the criterion\n- It uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n` instead of directly using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as specified\n- The filtering is for `n >= 100` rather than `n > 100` as specified\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct final result (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA values), it doesn't follow the methodology outlined in the criterion. The approach is different from what was expected.\n\nGRADE: P"

The answer directly identifies the core issue in the first paragraph: \"mutate() does not have a `by` argument\" and the user \"typed `by` rather than `.by`\"\n\n2. It clearly states the correction needed: \"Use `.by=`, **not** `by=`\" and provides correct example code showing:\n   ```r\n   mutate(df, newvar = ..., .by = c(id, date))\n   ```\n\n3. It explains that `.by` is the proper syntax for dplyr 1.1.0+, which is exactly what the user needs to know\n\n4. The submission offers multiple solutions with clear examples, including the traditional `group_by()` approach and the newer `.by` approach\n\n5. The submission provides a comprehensive explanation that addresses the exact issue mentioned in the criterion - the need to use `.by` instead of `by`\n\nThe submission directly and accurately addresses the criterion by identifying that the user typed `by` instead of `.by` and provides the correct solution.

Correctly adds a `name` parameter after `dataset` with the default value of `deparse(substitute(dataset))`, which captures the name of the variable passed as `dataset`.\n2.

However, it makes an incorrect statement that \"default argument expressions are evaluated in the local function frame, _before_ argument matching.\" This is not accurate - in R, default arguments are lazily evaluated, which is actually the cause of the problem.\n\nThe proposed solution does work, but for a different reason than what's stated in the criterion. The submission suggests using `name = NULL` as a default and then explicitly checking for NULL inside the function body to set the name. This approach works as a workaround, but it doesn't directly address the issue of lazy evaluation.\n\nThe criterion specifically mentions that `name` must be evaluated early in the function using `force(name)`. The submission doesn't mention `force()` at all, which is a standard R idiom for forcing early evaluation of arguments.\n\nA solution that would meet the criterion would look something like:\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = deparse(substitute(dataset)), dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  force(name)  # Force early evaluation of name\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe submission provides a working alternative solution but doesn't correctly explain the lazy evaluation issue or mention the required `force(name)` approach.\n\nGRADE: P"

Rather than using `force(name)` to ensure early evaluation of the default value, the submission:\n\n1. Changes the default for `name` to be `NULL` instead of `deparse(substitute(dataset))`\n2. Does the name extraction logic inside the function body using `match.call()`\n3. Determines the name after the function has already started executing\n\nThis approach avoids the lazy evaluation problem entirely by not using a complex expression as the default value. By setting `name = NULL` in the function signature and then handling the name determination as the first step inside the function, the solution ensures that the name is properly determined before the rest of the function logic runs.\n\nWhile this doesn't use `force(name)` as specifically mentioned in the criterion, it actually provides a more robust solution that addresses the root problem. The approach completely removes the laziness issue by changing the parameter default and implementing the logic differently.\n\nHowever, since the criterion specifically asked for early evaluation of the default value (e.g., using `force(name)`), and this submission implements a different approach that doesn't use the specified technique, I must consider it partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

Rather than using `force(name)` to ensure early evaluation of the default value, the submission:\n\n1. Changes the default for `name` to be `NULL` instead of `deparse(substitute(dataset))`\n2. Does the name extraction logic inside the function body using `match.call()`\n3. Determines the name after the function has already started executing\n\nThis approach avoids the lazy evaluation problem entirely by not using a complex expression as the default value. By setting `name = NULL` in the function signature and then handling the name determination as the first step inside the function, the solution ensures that the name is properly determined before the rest of the function logic runs.\n\nWhile this doesn't use `force(name)` as specifically mentioned in the criterion, it actually provides a more robust solution that addresses the root problem. The approach completely removes the laziness issue by changing the parameter default and implementing the logic differently.\n\nHowever, since the criterion specifically asked for early evaluation of the default value (e.g., using `force(name)`), and this submission implements a different approach that doesn't use the specified technique, I must consider it partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P"

This is the single most common issue with nested modules.\n\nLet's explain in detail:\n\n## What's happening?\n\n- In your `outer_UI()`, you call `inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))`.  \n  Since `ns` is from `outer1`, this resolves to `\"outer1-inner1\"`.\n- In your `inner_UI()`, you do `ns <- NS(id)`, so if id is `\"outer1-inner1\"`, then `ns(\"foo\")` will generate `\"outer1-inner1-foo\"`.\n- But in your **inner server**, you call `innerServer(\"inner1\")` (not `\"outer1-inner1\"`).\n\n**Conclusion:** The input/output IDs created by your UI and those operated on by your server do not match. They are out of sync.\n\n### Example mismatch\n\nThe UI is looking for `\"outer1-inner1-theGeneratedUI\"`,  \nbut the server is using IDs like `\"inner1-theGeneratedUI\"`.\n\n---\n\n## How to fix\n\nAlways **pass the *raw* sub-module id** (like `\"inner1\"`, **not** `ns(\"inner1\")`) to submodules, both in UI and server.\n\nThe `NS()` function inside the module will take care of it for you.\n\nSo:\n\n- Change  \n  `inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))`  \n  to  \n  `inner_UI(\"inner1\")`\n- And in server:  \n  already: `innerServer(\"inner1\")` (correct)\n\n---\n\n## Full working solution\n\nHere is your corrected code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(\"inner1\")),\n      column(4, inner_UI(\"inner2\")),\n      column(4, inner_UI(\"inner3\"))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session){\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session){\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n**You will now see:**  \n- The header\n- The dynamically generated UI (`h5`)\n- The `verbatimTextOutput`  \n- The chart  \n\nfor each inner module.\n\n---\n\n### Key rule for modules\n\n> **Never namespace submodule `id` yourself.**  \n> Pass raw submodule IDs, and let the `NS()` mechanism handle it.\n\n**Generalize:**  \n- For module-in-module: use raw submodule IDs at UI and server call-sites.\n\n---\n\n**Tip:** If you want to programmatically generate IDs, store the children `\"inner1\"`, `\"inner2\"`, etc. as a vector and iterate both in the UI and the server using a `for` loop or `lapply`, but do **not** pre-namespace."

              "type": "text",
              "text": "This is a **common confusion!** Let me break down what’s happening in your case:\n\n---\n\n### The Problem: Package Name vs Repository Name\n\n- **`DESCRIPTION`** in your package lists `Imports: spatialstuff`\n- **`Remotes:`** lists `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- **But on GitHub:**  \n  The repo is at `org/spatial-Stuff` (note the case and the hyphen/underscore), but the package inside it is defined, in its own `DESCRIPTION`, as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### How remotes work\n\n- The **Remotes** field tells R/`pak`/**devtools** to look for a package (`spatialstuff`) at a non-standard (i.e., not CRAN) location, specifically `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- The **actual name** (as R knows it) is always taken from the `Package:` field inside the package’s `DESCRIPTION`. That’s why you depend on `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff`.\n\n#### Why you get the error\n\n- When the workflow runs, it tries to install `spatialstuff` (package name).\n- It uses `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` and so will do `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`.\n- **If `spatial-Stuff` in GitHub does not contain a package called `spatialstuff` (as per `DESCRIPTION`), this fails.**\n- **Case sensitivity**: _On macOS and Windows_, file systems are usually case insensitive, so local testing works. On GitHub (Linux runner), they’re case sensitive, and problems show up if the package (directory) is mis-capitalized or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Causes\n\n1. **Repo and package name mismatch**  \n   That's okay: R always uses the internal `Package:` name.\n\n2. **But:** If the package source in the repo isn’t named or structured as R expects (e.g. the directory is not actually an R package, or the `DESCRIPTION` file is missing/invalid), install fails.\n\n3. **Cache/coherence issues**: Sometimes, if you try installing the wrong-case repo or a different package than expected, the install fails with the `Can't find package called spatialstuff` error.\n\n---\n\n### How to Debug and Fix\n\n1. **Check you can install from GitHub directly:**  \n   In a clean R session, run:\n   ```r\n   remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   or\n   ```r\n   pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   Does this give you a package called `spatialstuff`?  \n   Run `library(spatialstuff)` after to confirm.\n\n2. **Check the package’s `DESCRIPTION`**  \n   - Visit https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION — is there a line `Package: spatialstuff`?\n   - Is the DESCRIPTION at the top level of the repo?\n\n3. **Check case & structure**  \n   - Package name in `DESCRIPTION` is **case sensitive**.\n   - The import must exactly match the internal package name, not the repo name.\n\n4. **If it works locally but fails on GitHub**  \n   - Double-check for OS-specific case issues.\n   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or special characters in your remote field.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Correct Setup\n\n#### In your DESCRIPTION\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\nis **correct**, _if all the above checks pass_.\n\n---\n\n### Other possible fixes\n\n- If the GitHub repo is a _monorepo_ or the package is in a subdirectory, you need to specify that in your Remotes, e.g.:\n  ```\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n  ```\n- For devtools/pak, try:\n  ```r\n  pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n  ```\n  and see what error you get; it may be more descriptive.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n|                                     | repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) | package name (`spatialstuff`) |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Remotes:**                        | `org/spatial-Stuff`        |                               |\n| **Imports/Depends/Suggests:**       |                            | `spatialstuff`                |\n| **Package is installed as**         |                            | `spatialstuff`                |\n\n---\n\n## **Likely Cause in Your Case**\n\n- The GitHub repo `org/spatial-Stuff` does *not* expose a correctly-named R package called `spatialstuff` in its DESCRIPTION, or you're hitting a case/pathing error (especially likely on Linux runners).\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n- Manually try installing via remotes/pak as above and check what errors show up.\n- Check the DESCRIPTION file and structure of the spatial-Stuff repo.\n- Fix any mismatches, and it will likely work.\n\n---\n\n**If you post the actual repo URL and output of `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`, I can give a more targeted answer!**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThis is likely not user error in your package, but a mismatch/misconfiguration in the spatial-Stuff repository (or a case/structure issue). Your DESCRIPTION setup is correct for this scenario. If you can’t control the other repo, you need to coordinate with its maintainers to fix the structure or capitalization."

                      "text": "This is a **common confusion!** Let me break down what’s happening in your case:\n\n---\n\n### The Problem: Package Name vs Repository Name\n\n- **`DESCRIPTION`** in your package lists `Imports: spatialstuff`\n- **`Remotes:`** lists `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- **But on GitHub:**  \n  The repo is at `org/spatial-Stuff` (note the case and the hyphen/underscore), but the package inside it is defined, in its own `DESCRIPTION`, as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### How remotes work\n\n- The **Remotes** field tells R/`pak`/**devtools** to look for a package (`spatialstuff`) at a non-standard (i.e., not CRAN) location, specifically `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- The **actual name** (as R knows it) is always taken from the `Package:` field inside the package’s `DESCRIPTION`. That’s why you depend on `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff`.\n\n#### Why you get the error\n\n- When the workflow runs, it tries to install `spatialstuff` (package name).\n- It uses `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` and so will do `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`.\n- **If `spatial-Stuff` in GitHub does not contain a package called `spatialstuff` (as per `DESCRIPTION`), this fails.**\n- **Case sensitivity**: _On macOS and Windows_, file systems are usually case insensitive, so local testing works. On GitHub (Linux runner), they’re case sensitive, and problems show up if the package (directory) is mis-capitalized or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Causes\n\n1. **Repo and package name mismatch**  \n   That's okay: R always uses the internal `Package:` name.\n\n2. **But:** If the package source in the repo isn’t named or structured as R expects (e.g. the directory is not actually an R package, or the `DESCRIPTION` file is missing/invalid), install fails.\n\n3. **Cache/coherence issues**: Sometimes, if you try installing the wrong-case repo or a different package than expected, the install fails with the `Can't find package called spatialstuff` error.\n\n---\n\n### How to Debug and Fix\n\n1. **Check you can install from GitHub directly:**  \n   In a clean R session, run:\n   ```r\n   remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   or\n   ```r\n   pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   Does this give you a package called `spatialstuff`?  \n   Run `library(spatialstuff)` after to confirm.\n\n2. **Check the package’s `DESCRIPTION`**  \n   - Visit https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION — is there a line `Package: spatialstuff`?\n   - Is the DESCRIPTION at the top level of the repo?\n\n3. **Check case & structure**  \n   - Package name in `DESCRIPTION` is **case sensitive**.\n   - The import must exactly match the internal package name, not the repo name.\n\n4. **If it works locally but fails on GitHub**  \n   - Double-check for OS-specific case issues.\n   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or special characters in your remote field.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Correct Setup\n\n#### In your DESCRIPTION\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\nis **correct**, _if all the above checks pass_.\n\n---\n\n### Other possible fixes\n\n- If the GitHub repo is a _monorepo_ or the package is in a subdirectory, you need to specify that in your Remotes, e.g.:\n  ```\n  Remotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n  ```\n- For devtools/pak, try:\n  ```r\n  pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n  ```\n  and see what error you get; it may be more descriptive.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n|                                     | repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) | package name (`spatialstuff`) |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Remotes:**                        | `org/spatial-Stuff`        |                               |\n| **Imports/Depends/Suggests:**       |                            | `spatialstuff`                |\n| **Package is installed as**         |                            | `spatialstuff`                |\n\n---\n\n## **Likely Cause in Your Case**\n\n- The GitHub repo `org/spatial-Stuff` does *not* expose a correctly-named R package called `spatialstuff` in its DESCRIPTION, or you're hitting a case/pathing error (especially likely on Linux runners).\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n- Manually try installing via remotes/pak as above and check what errors show up.\n- Check the DESCRIPTION file and structure of the spatial-Stuff repo.\n- Fix any mismatches, and it will likely work.\n\n---\n\n**If you post the actual repo URL and output of `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`, I can give a more targeted answer!**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThis is likely not user error in your package, but a mismatch/misconfiguration in the spatial-Stuff repository (or a case/structure issue). Your DESCRIPTION setup is correct for this scenario. If you can’t control the other repo, you need to coordinate with its maintainers to fix the structure or capitalization."

Let’s break this down and clarify both the cause and the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **The problem**\n\n#### **What's happening?**\n\n- Your **DESCRIPTION** specifies:\n  \n  - Depends/Imports: `spatialstuff`\n  - Remotes: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n\n- The actual **GitHub repo** is `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **The package name inside the repo** is definitely set as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### **Error (from pak):**\n```\nCan't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this happen?**\n\nR, and specifically installation tools like `pak` or `remotes`, use the **Remotes** field to figure out where to find a package **only when needed**. The problem is, if the **GitHub repo name is not an exact match for the package name (case-sensitive! hyphens, underscores, etc.)**, sometimes tools don't pick up the link properly. This can especially bite you if:\n\n- The package is **not on CRAN**, only on GitHub.\n- The **Remotes** entry points to a repo whose *repo name* is not *verbatim* the package name.\n- The package source tarball (or `DESCRIPTION`) inside the repo states a different name than the repo.\n- Some dependency resolution tools do not scan `Remotes` until the package is actually about to be installed, so they don't know how to find `spatialstuff` if they're looking for it as a dependency.\n\n---\n\n### **How should you handle this?**\n\n#### **1. Your DESCRIPTION is actually correct.**\n- `Imports: spatialstuff` (Always the real package name)\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (Repo, even if the case/hyphens differ)\n\nThis is the **correct approach**: The `Remotes` field tells installation tools (like `remotes`, `devtools`, or `pak`) where to get *any package named `spatialstuff`* if it doesn’t find it in standard repositories.\n\n#### **2. This breaks only for certain installation tools**\n\n- Most of the time, `remotes::install_deps()` or `pak::pak()` does the right thing.\n- But for some CI/CD or automated build tools (like those used by `pkgdown` workflows), if the dependency is not on CRAN, and the name-repo mismatch exists, it can get confused and fail to resolve the package.\n\n---\n\n### **Troubleshooting / Solutions**\n\n#### **A. Confirm the actual package name in the remote repo**\n\nCheck that `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` contains:\n\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\n\n#### **B. Ensure your `Remotes` field is present and correct**\n\nShould be in your `DESCRIPTION`:\n\n```yaml\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n#### **C. (Best) Use `pak` or latest `remotes` to install dependencies, not `install.packages`**\n\nMake sure that in your GitHub Actions `pkgdown` workflow, the step that installs dependencies uses `pak` or recent `remotes`, NOT base `install.packages()`. Eg, a common setup is:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n  with:\n    extra-packages: |\n      any::pak\n      any::rmarkdown\n    cache: true\n```\nOr (for remotes):\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install Dependencies\n  run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'\n```\nBut beware: sometimes, especially with `usethis` generated workflows, an older action or method might skip the `Remotes` field!\n\n#### **D. If all else fails — Add an explicit install step**\n\nIn your workflow, right before the dependencies step, put:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install spatialstuff from GitHub\n  run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\n\nThis forces the package to be installed so it will be found as a dependency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Field          | Value                   | Purpose                                 |\n|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Imports        | spatialstuff           | The package name (from DESCRIPTION)     |\n| Remotes        | org/spatial-Stuff      | The repo to fetch if not on CRAN        |\n\n**Keep these as shown.**  \n**You do NOT try to refer to the repo as `spatial-Stuff`, always use the package name for Imports/Depends.**\n\n---\n\n### **Why is this an issue?**\n\nIt's because R's tools are not always smart enough to link the package name (`spatialstuff`) and the repo name (`spatial-Stuff`) unless they're nudged, so explicit installs or ensuring that your dependency installer honors the `Remotes` field is essential.\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n- Your package is correct.\n- This error comes from how the workflow installs dependencies.\n- Ensure that you use a dependency installer (like `pak` or `remotes`) that **honors the `Remotes` field**.\n- If the workflow still fails, insert an explicit install step for the remote package using `remotes::install_github()` **before** installing the rest of your dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- [R Packages -- Non-CRAN Remotes](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#remotes)\n- [GitHub Actions best practices for R](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r-dependencies)\n- Hadley's [commentary on Remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/296)\n\nLet me know if you want a sample workflow step to patch this!"

Let’s break this down and clarify both the cause and the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **The problem**\n\n#### **What's happening?**\n\n- Your **DESCRIPTION** specifies:\n  \n  - Depends/Imports: `spatialstuff`\n  - Remotes: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n\n- The actual **GitHub repo** is `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **The package name inside the repo** is definitely set as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### **Error (from pak):**\n```\nCan't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this happen?**\n\nR, and specifically installation tools like `pak` or `remotes`, use the **Remotes** field to figure out where to find a package **only when needed**. The problem is, if the **GitHub repo name is not an exact match for the package name (case-sensitive! hyphens, underscores, etc.)**, sometimes tools don't pick up the link properly. This can especially bite you if:\n\n- The package is **not on CRAN**, only on GitHub.\n- The **Remotes** entry points to a repo whose *repo name* is not *verbatim* the package name.\n- The package source tarball (or `DESCRIPTION`) inside the repo states a different name than the repo.\n- Some dependency resolution tools do not scan `Remotes` until the package is actually about to be installed, so they don't know how to find `spatialstuff` if they're looking for it as a dependency.\n\n---\n\n### **How should you handle this?**\n\n#### **1.

                  "text": "Great, you have run into a **common R package development issue** related to Dependencies from GitHub where the **package name** differs from the **GitHub repo name**. Let’s break this down and clarify both the cause and the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **The problem**\n\n#### **What's happening?**\n\n- Your **DESCRIPTION** specifies:\n  \n  - Depends/Imports: `spatialstuff`\n  - Remotes: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n\n- The actual **GitHub repo** is `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **The package name inside the repo** is definitely set as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### **Error (from pak):**\n```\nCan't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Why does this happen?**\n\nR, and specifically installation tools like `pak` or `remotes`, use the **Remotes** field to figure out where to find a package **only when needed**. The problem is, if the **GitHub repo name is not an exact match for the package name (case-sensitive! hyphens, underscores, etc.)**, sometimes tools don't pick up the link properly. This can especially bite you if:\n\n- The package is **not on CRAN**, only on GitHub.\n- The **Remotes** entry points to a repo whose *repo name* is not *verbatim* the package name.\n- The package source tarball (or `DESCRIPTION`) inside the repo states a different name than the repo.\n- Some dependency resolution tools do not scan `Remotes` until the package is actually about to be installed, so they don't know how to find `spatialstuff` if they're looking for it as a dependency.\n\n---\n\n### **How should you handle this?**\n\n#### **1. Your DESCRIPTION is actually correct.**\n- `Imports: spatialstuff` (Always the real package name)\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (Repo, even if the case/hyphens differ)\n\nThis is the **correct approach**: The `Remotes` field tells installation tools (like `remotes`, `devtools`, or `pak`) where to get *any package named `spatialstuff`* if it doesn’t find it in standard repositories.\n\n#### **2. This breaks only for certain installation tools**\n\n- Most of the time, `remotes::install_deps()` or `pak::pak()` does the right thing.\n- But for some CI/CD or automated build tools (like those used by `pkgdown` workflows), if the dependency is not on CRAN, and the name-repo mismatch exists, it can get confused and fail to resolve the package.\n\n---\n\n### **Troubleshooting / Solutions**\n\n#### **A. Confirm the actual package name in the remote repo**\n\nCheck that `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` contains:\n\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\n\n#### **B. Ensure your `Remotes` field is present and correct**\n\nShould be in your `DESCRIPTION`:\n\n```yaml\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n#### **C. (Best) Use `pak` or latest `remotes` to install dependencies, not `install.packages`**\n\nMake sure that in your GitHub Actions `pkgdown` workflow, the step that installs dependencies uses `pak` or recent `remotes`, NOT base `install.packages()`.

R package names should be all lowercase and match exactly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Using pak vs. remotes**\nThe error is from **pak**, which is more strict about resolution. Sometimes, remotes can succeed where pak fails, if Remotes is mis-specified.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **What to do**\n\n### **Quick checklist:**\n\n1. **Go to https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION**  \n   - Confirm the package line: `Package: spatialstuff`\n   - If not, you **MUST** use the actual package name. (You cannot alias it!)\n\n2. **Try locally:**\n   - `pak::pkg_install('org/spatial-Stuff')`\n   - Or: `remotes::install_github('org/spatial-Stuff')`\n   - Does it install?\n   - Can you then run `library(spatialstuff)`?  \n   - If not, the package name is mismatched.\n\n3. **Resolve naming**\n   - If the package itself is called `spatial-Stuff`, you must use:\n     ```\n     Imports:\n       spatial-Stuff\n     ```\n     **and** refer to `spatial-Stuff` in code (which is awkward and non-standard). Package names in R are ideally all lowercase, no dashes.\n\n4. **Subdirectory issues**\n   If the package is in a subfolder, e.g., `R/spatialstuff`, add:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. **User error or not?**\n\nAlmost always this error is due to **mismatch in package naming** between your DESCRIPTION file and the actual package you are pulling from GitHub.\n\n|  | |\n|--|--|\n| **User error?** | Almost certainly: Yes |\n| **Remedy?** | Ensure your `Imports:` is the exact name as in the remote package's `Package:` field. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Repo             | DESCRIPTION:Package | Your Imports: | Should work? |  \n|------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatialstuff       | spatialstuff | Yes          |  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatial-Stuff      | spatialstuff | **No**       |  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatial-Stuff      | spatial-Stuff| Yes          |  \n| spatial-Stuff (subdir)| spatialstuff   | spatialstuff | Only with `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff/subdir` |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **TL;DR**\n\n- **`Imports:` must exactly match the package's name as declared in its DESCRIPTION file on GitHub.**\n- **`Remotes:` must point to the repo (and subdir, if needed) containing the package.**\n- Capitalization and dashes matter!\n- Test with `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` to see what package it attempts to install.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Double-check the package name in the remote DESCRIPTION.\n- Align your `Imports:` to match it **exactly**.\n- Try a manual install locally to debug.\n\n**If these steps do not resolve it, post the lines from the remote package's DESCRIPTION file and your DESCRIPTION, and any install output for further help!**\n\n---\n\n**If you post the actual repo and package name (if not private), I can inspect and give an exact answer!**\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

However, it does not explicitly mention the solution specified in the criterion - using the `<package>=` prefix in the Remotes field.\n\nWhile the answer does correctly identify that there's likely a mismatch between the package name and repository name, and suggests several troubleshooting approaches, it never suggests the specific syntax required by the criterion:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThe answer discusses making sure the imports match the package name and points to various other solutions, but it doesn't highlight this specific syntax requirement for the Remotes field.

Package names in R are ideally all lowercase, no dashes.\n\n4. **Subdirectory issues**\n   If the package is in a subfolder, e.g., `R/spatialstuff`, add:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. **User error or not?**\n\nAlmost always this error is due to **mismatch in package naming** between your DESCRIPTION file and the actual package you are pulling from GitHub.\n\n|  | |\n|--|--|\n| **User error?** | Almost certainly: Yes |\n| **Remedy?** | Ensure your `Imports:` is the exact name as in the remote package's `Package:` field. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Repo             | DESCRIPTION:Package | Your Imports: | Should work? |  \n|------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatialstuff       | spatialstuff | Yes          |  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatial-Stuff      | spatialstuff | **No**       |  \n| spatial-Stuff    | spatial-Stuff      | spatial-Stuff| Yes          |  \n| spatial-Stuff (subdir)| spatialstuff   | spatialstuff | Only with `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff/subdir` |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **TL;DR**\n\n- **`Imports:` must exactly match the package's name as declared in its DESCRIPTION file on GitHub.**\n- **`Remotes:` must point to the repo (and subdir, if needed) containing the package.**\n- Capitalization and dashes matter!\n- Test with `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` to see what package it attempts to install.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Double-check the package name in the remote DESCRIPTION.\n- Align your `Imports:` to match it **exactly**.\n- Try a manual install locally to debug.\n\n**If these steps do not resolve it, post the lines from the remote package's DESCRIPTION file and your DESCRIPTION, and any install output for further help!**\n\n---\n\n**If you post the actual repo and package name (if not private), I can inspect and give an exact answer!**",

However, you are also dynamically assigning a method (`foo`) inside `initialize()` using `self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...`, which works when you create a `Parent` object, but it **conflicts** if a method with the same name is already defined in the class (such as in `Child`).\n\n## Problem\n\n- In `Parent`, method `foo` is **not** defined in `public` — it's dynamically created on object instantiation.\n- In `Child`, method `foo` **is** defined in `public` — it’s fixed once, for all objects.\n- When `Child$new()` is called, the `Parent`'s `initialize()` tries to assign a new `foo` method, **but** the public list in `Child` already “owns” that slot, and it's locked.\n\n> **Error:**  \n> `cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'`\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix\n\nYou must **not dynamically assign** a method to a name that's already present in `public`—otherwise, assignment will fail due to the locked binding protection.\n\n### Solution 1: Only define `foo` in one place\n\nIn general, **prefer static method definitions** (in `public` list) over dynamic assignments.\n\n#### **Define `foo` in the class body:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()  # works, prints 'foo'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Solution 2: Do not assign `foo` dynamically in `initialize()`\n\nIf your use case absolutely requires you to assign methods dynamically, ensure you're not conflicting with statically defined methods.\n\n#### Only assign dynamically **if not already defined**:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      # Only assign foo if not present\n      if (!\"foo\" %in% names(self)) {\n        self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n          print('foo')\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Solution 3: Define all methods in the class body, and if you need customization, use inheritance.\n\nIf you have to dynamically generate methods, consider doing it **before** the class is constructed, to ensure it's part of the class definition and not per-instance.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Dynamic parent | Static child | Outcome                          |\n|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| `self[[\"foo\"]]` in `initialize` | `foo = function` in `public` | **ERROR** (`locked binding`)    |\n\n| Static parent  | Static child | Outcome                          |\n|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| `foo = function` in `public`  | `foo = function` in `public`    | OK                             |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice**\n\nFor R6 classes, **define methods in the `public` list** unless you have an advanced need otherwise.  \nDynamically assigning methods is possible, but can cause issues with inheritance and should be used only with care.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n**Don't assign methods dynamically that are already defined in the class body.  \nAssign `foo` statically in the parent and override in the child.**  \nYour example works if you move `foo` to the parent class's `public` list."

Specifically, in your inner function:\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat = chat) { ... }\n```\n\nHere, the *default argument* `chat = chat` tries to refer to a variable `chat`, but within the body of the argument list, `chat` means *the argument currently being defined*, not the variable from the outer environment. This leads to the recursive reference problem.\n\n**How to fix:**\n\nThe fix is to avoid using `chat = chat` in the function argument defaults. Instead, one pattern is to explicitly pass the outer `chat` object via closure. For example:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    # Use chat_override if given, otherwise use the original chat\n    ch <- if (!is.null(chat_override)) chat_override$clone() else chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr, **if you don't need runtime overriding**, just omit the `chat` argument from the inner function:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr, if you do want the option to override, but avoid the scoping problem, use a different name:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_override$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nDo not use a default argument like `chat = chat`.

The submission's approach would work correctly, but it differs in implementation details from the exemplar solution.\n\nGiven that the core requirements are met but the implementation differs from the exemplar, this is a partially correct answer.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies the issue with the `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function and properly moves it into a server function.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core issue: the code defines `output$plot` in the global environment (outside the server function) and then only references it inside the server function with `output$plot`. The submission explains that Shiny outputs must be defined inside the server function.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission:\n1. Correctly moves all reactive expressions and output definitions inside the server function\n2. Properly structures the server function with the `output$plot` rendering code inside it\n3. Explains the distinction between global and server contexts\n4. Shows how to fix the code by moving everything to the appropriate context\n\nThe submission's solution is slightly different from the example in the criterion (it simplifies some reactive expressions), but it addresses the same core problem in a valid way. It correctly identifies that the `output$plot` needs to be moved inside the server function along with all other reactive code.\n\nGRADE: C",

At that point, `input` and `output` are **not defined**.\n- Your `reactive()` functions (like `ckd_condition`, `visit_threshold`, `filtered_data`) are also being created globally, not inside the server function.\n- At the end, your `server` function does **not** define any outputs: you're just referencing `output$plot` but not recreating it.\n\nShiny outputs (`render*`, e.g., `renderPlot`) and anything referring to `input$something` **must be defined inside the `server` function**.\n\n---\n\n## Here's how to fix your code\n\nMove all the `reactive`s and the `output$plot` definition **inside** the `server` function definition.  \nGlobally, just load your data.\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data (can stay global)\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    # ckd_condition is just input$condition, no need for separate reactive\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create linear model and plot (plot output must be inside server!)\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data available for this selection\")\n    )\n    # Check if needed columns exist\n    req(\"Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED\" %in% colnames(data), \"VISIT_COUNT\" %in% colnames(data))\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n## Summary of fixes\n\n- **Move everything using `input$...` and `output$...` into `server`.**\n- Only data loading stays global.\n- No need for separate `ckd_condition()`/`visit_threshold()` reactives -- just use `input$condition`/`input$visit_threshold` directly.\n- At the end, call `shinyApp(ui, server)`.\n\n---\n\n**General rule:**  \n> Only pure data (never use input/output/reactive values) in `global.R`/outside `server`.  \n> All logic using `input`, `output`, reactive(), renderX() etc. **must** be inside your `server` function.\n\n---\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nIf you ever see errors like  \n`output$plot : Can't read output ...`  \nor  \n`object 'input' not found`,  \nit's a sign you're trying to use Shiny's dynamic UI/mechanics outside the server context.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function.

The submission explains that Shiny outputs must be defined inside the server function.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission:\n1. Correctly moves all reactive expressions and output definitions inside the server function\n2. Properly structures the server function with the `output$plot` rendering code inside it\n3. Explains the distinction between global and server contexts\n4. Shows how to fix the code by moving everything to the appropriate context\n\nThe submission's solution is slightly different from the example in the criterion (it simplifies some reactive expressions), but it addresses the same core problem in a valid way. It correctly identifies that the `output$plot` needs to be moved inside the server function along with all other reactive code.\n\nGRADE: C"

You can define your data loading outside (global), but all reactivity should be inside.\n\nAlso, `filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, ...)` is incorrect. `ckd_condition` is a function, so you must call it: `ckd_condition()`.\n\n#### Fixed Version\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"No data for this selection\")\n      return()\n    }\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Move all reactives and outputs into the `server` function.\n- Fix references from `ckd_condition` to `input$condition`, and similar for `visit_threshold`.\n- Do NOT try to define outputs outside `server`.\n\nThis should fix your error.

In Shiny, your `server` function is called with `(input, output, session)` arguments, and should contain any `reactive` and `render*` expressions (wrapped inside the function). You can't define reactivity and outputs _outside_ the server function and then just return `output$plot`.\n\n#### In your code, you have:\n```r\n# ... reactive and renderPlot code here, OUTSIDE the server function\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n  output$plot\n})\n```\nThis means `output$plot` is being referenced before it exists, and all your reactivity is outside the server function, so it's not connected to the running app.\n\n### Solution\n\n**All server logic must be inside the `server` function.** Move all `reactive` and `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` code-inside-shiny's `server` function. You can define your data loading outside (global), but all reactivity should be inside.\n\nAlso, `filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, ...)` is incorrect. `ckd_condition` is a function, so you must call it: `ckd_condition()`.\n\n#### Fixed Version\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"No data for this selection\")\n      return()\n    }\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Move all reactives and outputs into the `server` function.\n- Fix references from `ckd_condition` to `input$condition`, and similar for `visit_threshold`.\n- Do NOT try to define outputs outside `server`.\n\nThis should fix your error.

This error:\n\n```\nError in output$plot : Can't read output 'plot'\n```\n\n**Core issue:**  \nThe code that defines `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` is running **outside** your `server` function.  \nIn Shiny, all `output$... <- render...({ ... })` assignments must happen _within_ the `server` function, because the `input` variable (the user’s controls) is only available there.\n\n**Also:**  \n- Your `reactive()` expressions are defined globally and not using the `input` variable from the server scope, so they won’t work.\n- The `server` function in your `shinyApp` only contains `output$plot` (a reference); it needs to contain the code itself — i.e., the logic for creating `output$plot`.\n\n---\n\n## Fix: Move All Reactives and `output$plot` into the `server` function\n\nHere's a **fully corrected minimal example**:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  \n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    # Note: just use input$condition, not ckd_condition()\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    # If there's a possibility data could be empty, you might guard against that\n    if(nrow(data)==0) return(NULL)\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n  \n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key Changes and Explanations**\n\n1. **All Reactives and Outputs in Server:**  \n   All the code using `input` variables, both reactive expressions and `output$plot`, are now defined inside the `server` function, where `input` is valid.\n\n2. **No More `reactive()` for Simple Use:**  \n   You **do not** need `ckd_condition <- reactive({ input$condition })`, just use `input$condition` directly. The same for `visit_threshold`.\n\n3. **Supply the Actual `output$plot` definition:**  \n   You must provide the code for `output$plot` in the server, rather than just referencing it.\n\n4. **Use `input$...` directly:**  \n   Your filter now uses `filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, ...)`, not `... == ckd_condition`.\n\n5. **(Optional)** Guard against empty data frames in case there are no records matching filter.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **All output definitions and reactives must be inside the server function.**\n- **Do not write code that uses `input` globally (outside of server).**\n- Your error occurs because you're trying to refer to an output (and inputs) before the server and UI exist in the correct structure!\n\n---\n\nThat should fix your error.

The answer provides a complete solution that:\n\n1. Correctly identifies that all reactives and output assignments need to be inside the server function\n2. Provides a complete code example with the server function properly defined, including:\n   - Moving all the reactive expressions inside the server function\n   - Moving the `output$plot` definition inside the server function\n   - Properly referencing `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` directly\n3. Explains that you don't need separate reactive expressions for simple inputs\n4. Adds additional helpful information about guarding against empty data frames\n\nThe solution is comprehensive, correct, and even goes beyond the minimal fix by addressing other potential issues in the code.

The same for `visit_threshold`.\n\n3. **Supply the Actual `output$plot` definition:**  \n   You must provide the code for `output$plot` in the server, rather than just referencing it.\n\n4. **Use `input$...` directly:**  \n   Your filter now uses `filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, ...)`, not `... == ckd_condition`.\n\n5. **(Optional)** Guard against empty data frames in case there are no records matching filter.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **All output definitions and reactives must be inside the server function.**\n- **Do not write code that uses `input` globally (outside of server).**\n- Your error occurs because you're trying to refer to an output (and inputs) before the server and UI exist in the correct structure!\n\n---\n\nThat should fix your error.

This error:\n\n```\nError in output$plot : Can't read output 'plot'\n```\n\n**Core issue:**  \nThe code that defines `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` is running **outside** your `server` function.  \nIn Shiny, all `output$... <- render...({ ... })` assignments must happen _within_ the `server` function, because the `input` variable (the user’s controls) is only available there.\n\n**Also:**  \n- Your `reactive()` expressions are defined globally and not using the `input` variable from the server scope, so they won’t work.\n- The `server` function in your `shinyApp` only contains `output$plot` (a reference); it needs to contain the code itself — i.e., the logic for creating `output$plot`.\n\n---\n\n## Fix: Move All Reactives and `output$plot` into the `server` function\n\nHere's a **fully corrected minimal example**:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  \n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    # Note: just use input$condition, not ckd_condition()\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    # If there's a possibility data could be empty, you might guard against that\n    if(nrow(data)==0) return(NULL)\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n  \n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key Changes and Explanations**\n\n1. **All Reactives and Outputs in Server:**  \n   All the code using `input` variables, both reactive expressions and `output$plot`, are now defined inside the `server` function, where `input` is valid.\n\n2. **No More `reactive()` for Simple Use:**  \n   You **do not** need `ckd_condition <- reactive({ input$condition })`, just use `input$condition` directly. The same for `visit_threshold`.\n\n3. **Supply the Actual `output$plot` definition:**  \n   You must provide the code for `output$plot` in the server, rather than just referencing it.\n\n4. **Use `input$...` directly:**  \n   Your filter now uses `filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, ...)`, not `... == ckd_condition`.\n\n5. **(Optional)** Guard against empty data frames in case there are no records matching filter.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **All output definitions and reactives must be inside the server function.**\n- **Do not write code that uses `input` globally (outside of server).**\n- Your error occurs because you're trying to refer to an output (and inputs) before the server and UI exist in the correct structure!\n\n---\n\nThat should fix your error.

The submission captures the essential pattern of calling `str_replace()` twice in sequence.\n\n2. Option 2 uses a single regex with backreferences, which doesn't match the criterion of calling `str_replace()` twice.\n\n3. Option 3 uses `separate()` and `paste0()`, which also doesn't match the criterion.\n\nWhile Options 2 and 3 provide alternative valid approaches, the criterion specifically calls for using `str_replace()` twice in sequence. Option 1 directly satisfies this requirement, so the submission is correct.\n\nGRADE: C"

A **semi-join** keeps **rows from the first data frame (`df2`) where there are matching rows in the second data frame (`df1`) based on specified columns**. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n```\n\nThis will **keep only the rows from `df2`** where the combination of `key1` and `key2` also exists in `df1`.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\")` tells `semi_join` to match on these columns.\n- All columns in `df2` (e.g. `var3`, `var4`) are retained.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf1 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 3, 4),\n  var3 = 10:13,\n  var4 = letters[1:4]\n)\n\ndf2 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'e', 'f'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 4, 5),\n  var3 = 20:23,\n  var4 = letters[5:8]\n)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n\nprint(common_df)\n```\n**Expected Output:**\n```\n  key1 key2 var3 var4\n1    a    1   20    e\n2    b    2   21    f\n```\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using `inner_join`\n\nIf you want to **retain `df2`'s extra columns** but do a full match, you can also use `inner_join`:\n\n```r\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  inner_join(df1 %>% select(key1, key2), by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n```\nBut if `df2` and `df1` both have columns with the same name besides the keys, you'll get suffixes.\n\nFor your case, `semi_join` is the cleanest approach!",

Here is your updated error message:\n\n```r\ncli::cli_warn(c(\n  \"Values from {duplicate_names} are not uniquely identified; output will contain list-cols.\",\n  \"*\" = \"Use `values_fn = list` to suppress this warning.\",\n  \"*\" = \"Use `values_fn = {{summary_fun}}` to summarise duplicates.\",\n  \"*\" = \"Use the following dplyr code to identify duplicates.\",\n  \" \" = \"  {{data}} %>%\",\n  \" \" = \"    dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .by = {group_cols}) %>%\",\n  \" \" = \"    dplyr::filter(n > 1L)\"\n))\n```\n\n**Key change:**  \nReplace\n```\ndplyr::group_by({group_cols}) %>%\ndplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n```\nwith  \n```\ndplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .by = {group_cols}) %>%\n```\n\nThis takes advantage of the new `.by` argument in `summarise()`.",

Furthermore, `expect_warning()`'s syntax now prefers the use of `regexp=` for clarity, especially when matching messages.\n\nAdditionally, **backslashes in regular expressions** should generally be single, since the string isn't being double-escaped inside the `expect_warning()` call; your message may not need the `\\\\` in all contexts, but for maximal compatibility, you can leave it.\n\nHere’s a direct translation to **testthat 3e** syntax:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"check_ellipses() gives appropriate warning for unsupported argument\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    regexp = \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy\\\\(\\\\)` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `test_that()` to organize your test into a named test block (aligns with best practices in testthat 3e, though not a strict requirement).\n- Use the `regexp=` argument for matching warnings for clarity and future compatibility.\n- The regular expression string can just use `` ` `` (backticks) or double backslashes if there’s a need (depending on how your function actually prints the warning).\n\nIf you don't want to wrap it in `test_that()` and just want a one-liner, here's the update:\n\n```r\nexpect_warning(\n  check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n  regexp = \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy\\\\(\\\\)` method for `boop` objects\"\n)\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nChange the second argument from a bare string to `regexp = ...` and wrap into `test_that()` if you are updating your test files for testthat 3e.",

              "text": "This error is happening because of incorrect usage of `across()`, specifically the `.names = \"x\"` part. Let’s break down the issues:\n\n### Problems\n\n1. **`.names = \"x\"`**  \n   The `.names` argument is a format string that determines how the new column names are constructed, *not* the literal output column names. So `.names = \"x\"` tries to name the new column \"x\", which is odd but acceptable (you just get a column named `x`). However, usually you want `.names = \"{.col}_suffix\"` or similar. The default behavior is usually fine for simple operations.\n\n2. **Trailing comma**\n   There's an extra comma before the closing parenthesis in `.names = \"x\",`, which may create confusion in function arguments.\n\n3. **Function notation**\n   Your use of `\\(x) x + 1` is fine in R 4.1+, but if you want to make your code more universal, use `function(x) x + 1`.\n\n### Minimal working example\n\nLet’s do the simplest working case:\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x +1))\n```\nThis simply adds 1 to the `vs` column, and replaces it.\n\nIf you **want a new column** (not overwrite `vs`), use:\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(vs_plus1 = vs + 1)\n```\n\nOr, with `across()` to apply to multiple columns at once (as intended):\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(c(vs), \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\nThis creates a new column called `vs_plus1`.\n\n### The key fix\n\n**Your code, fixed:**\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_new\"))\n```\n\nOr, if you want to name it just \"x\" (not recommended, but possible):\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\nBut generally, you should use `.names = \"{.col}_something\"`.\n\n### Summary\n\n- `.names` controls output column names; give it a pattern like `\"{.col}_new\"`\n- Avoid extra commas.\n- Use vector of column names for `across()` if you want to scale to multiple columns.\n- R 4.1+ supports `\\(x) ...` syntax; otherwise use `function(x) ...`\n\n----\n\n**Final recommended code:**\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\nThis will produce a new column `vs_plus1` with `vs` incremented by 1."

                  "text": "This error is happening because of incorrect usage of `across()`, specifically the `.names = \"x\"` part. Let’s break down the issues:\n\n### Problems\n\n1. **`.names = \"x\"`**  \n   The `.names` argument is a format string that determines how the new column names are constructed, *not* the literal output column names. So `.names = \"x\"` tries to name the new column \"x\", which is odd but acceptable (you just get a column named `x`). However, usually you want `.names = \"{.col}_suffix\"` or similar. The default behavior is usually fine for simple operations.\n\n2. **Trailing comma**\n   There's an extra comma before the closing parenthesis in `.names = \"x\",`, which may create confusion in function arguments.\n\n3. **Function notation**\n   Your use of `\\(x) x + 1` is fine in R 4.1+, but if you want to make your code more universal, use `function(x) x + 1`.\n\n### Minimal working example\n\nLet’s do the simplest working case:\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x +1))\n```\nThis simply adds 1 to the `vs` column, and replaces it.\n\nIf you **want a new column** (not overwrite `vs`), use:\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(vs_plus1 = vs + 1)\n```\n\nOr, with `across()` to apply to multiple columns at once (as intended):\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(c(vs), \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\nThis creates a new column called `vs_plus1`.\n\n### The key fix\n\n**Your code, fixed:**\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_new\"))\n```\n\nOr, if you want to name it just \"x\" (not recommended, but possible):\n```r\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\nBut generally, you should use `.names = \"{.col}_something\"`.\n\n### Summary\n\n- `.names` controls output column names; give it a pattern like `\"{.col}_new\"`\n- Avoid extra commas.\n- Use vector of column names for `across()` if you want to scale to multiple columns.\n- R 4.1+ supports `\\(x) ...` syntax; otherwise use `function(x) ...`\n\n----\n\n**Final recommended code:**\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\nThis will produce a new column `vs_plus1` with `vs` incremented by 1.",

You're running into a common issue when using non-exported (internal) functions from other R packages like **dplyr**.\n\n### What's happening?\n\n- **`dplyr::closest()` fails** because `closest` is not an **exported** function from dplyr, so it cannot be accessed via the usual `::` operator.\n- Just using `closest()` works if you have called `library(dplyr)` somewhere (or if another function/namespace loads it into your search path), **but** this is not robust coding practice for package development and causes lint/build issues.\n\n## Why is `closest` not exported?\n\nSome functions inside packages are not meant to be used by package users (they are \"internal\" helpers). Such functions:\n- Are NOT listed in the package's NAMESPACE `export` directive\n- Cannot be accessed via `dplyr::closest()`\n- Are not part of the official API and may change or disappear in future releases\n\n## What should you do?\n\nYou have **three safer options**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Do Not Use Internal Functions**\n\n**Best practice:** *Never use unexported/internal functions from other packages in your package code*. If you need the functionality, it's better to:\n- Copy the relevant function code into your package (if the license permits), or\n- Find an exported alternative, or\n- Implement your own version.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Import With `:::`, but This Is NOT Recommended**\n\nYou *can* access internal functions with triple colon, e.g. `dplyr:::closest()`.  \nBut:\n- CRAN policies frown upon use of `:::`.\n- It’s fragile: internals may change or disappear without notice.\n- Lint/build tools flag this with warnings or notes.\n\n**Example:**\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\nIf you **must** do this, at least wrap in `tryCatch()` and provide a fallback.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Copy The Function Into Your Package**\n\n- Check `?dplyr::closest`—if it's not documented, see its code:  \n  ```r\n  dplyr:::closest\n  ```\n- Copy (with citation and according to license) into your package's R folder as (e.g.) `closest_dplyr.R`.\n- Rename it (e.g. `dplyr_closest()`) for clarity.\n- **Document its origin and license in your code**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Ask: Do you really need this function?**\n- Are you using `dplyr::closest()` in response to something that can be done *via* exported dplyr verbs?  \n- There may be an official, public way to do what you want.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Approach                 | Lint/Build OK? | CRAN Safe? | Robust? | Recommendation              |\n|--------------------------|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------:|:----------------------------|\n| `dplyr::closest()`       |      ❌        |     ❌     |   ❌    | Not possible                |\n| `dplyr:::closest()`      |      ⚠️        |     ⚠️     |   ❌    | Not recommended (use at risk) |\n| Copy function into yours |      ✅        |     ✅     |   ✅    | Best if license permits     |\n| Find/exported alternative|      ✅        |     ✅     |   ✅    | Ideal if possible           |\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n> **You cannot refer to `dplyr::closest()` because it's not exported.

You're running into a common issue in R package development.\n\n### What’s happening?\n\n- `closest()` is a **non-exported** function in `dplyr`, i.e., it's **internal**.  \n- Non-exported functions **cannot be called using** `dplyr::closest()`. You must call them **unqualified** (`closest()`) **after attaching** `dplyr` or importing specifically.\n- In your **package code**, unqualified use works *only* because `dplyr` is attached/interpreted in your session—which is bad practice for packages, and **triggers linter and `R CMD check` notes/warnings**.\n\n---\n\n## Why is this a problem?\n\nYou should **not** rely on internal (non-exported) functions from other packages, because:\n- They are **not guaranteed to be stable** and may change or disappear at any time.\n- It is **hard to guarantee** your package’s code will work in all contexts.\n- CRAN and good practice dictate **importing only public APIs** of other packages.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix This\n\n#### **Option 1: Copy the implementation**\n\nSince `dplyr::closest()` is **not exported**, you **should not use it** directly. Instead, copy the relevant code into your own package (respecting the package license, note attribution if required).\n\n#### **Option 2: Ask the maintainers**\n\nIf this function is critical, you can [open an issue with dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) and request export of `closest()`.\n\n#### **Option 3: Use another public function**\n\nCheck if there’s an **exported equivalent** in dplyr or another package you can use instead.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Copying the function\n\n1. Locate the source for `closest()` in dplyr's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)  \n2. Copy the function into your package's R/ directory, rename if possible, and attribute in a comment:\n\n```r\n# Internal version based on dplyr:::closest\nclosest_row <- function(x, y) {\n  # function body copied from dplyr source\n}\n```\n3. Use `closest_row()` in your code.  \n4. Remove any calls to `closest()` or to `dplyr::closest()`.\n\n---\n\n### Why you shouldn't use `dplyr:::closest`\n\n- Using the `:::` operator (triple colon) is dangerous; it circumvents package encapsulation and breaks on updates. Never use it in package code.\n\n---\n\n### In summary\n\n- ❌ **Don't:** Rely on non-exported functions from dependencies in package code.\n- ✅ **Do:** Copy internals if necessary (with attribution), or find/use an exported/public alternative.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n- [R Packages: Imports](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html)\n- [Writing R Extensions - Good Practices](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Good-practice)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYou can't do `dplyr::closest()` because it's not exported.  \n**Copy the function to your package** (with credit!) if you need it, or ask dplyr maintainers to export it, or find an alternative.  \n**Do not use `dplyr:::closest()`.**\n\nIf you tell me what you're using `closest()` for, I can help find (or write) a suitable replacement!"

You're running into a common issue in R package development.\n\n### What’s happening?\n\n- `closest()` is a **non-exported** function in `dplyr`, i.e., it's **internal**.  \n- Non-exported functions **cannot be called using** `dplyr::closest()`. You must call them **unqualified** (`closest()`) **after attaching** `dplyr` or importing specifically.\n- In your **package code**, unqualified use works *only* because `dplyr` is attached/interpreted in your session—which is bad practice for packages, and **triggers linter and `R CMD check` notes/warnings**.\n\n---\n\n## Why is this a problem?\n\nYou should **not** rely on internal (non-exported) functions from other packages, because:\n- They are **not guaranteed to be stable** and may change or disappear at any time.\n- It is **hard to guarantee** your package’s code will work in all contexts.\n- CRAN and good practice dictate **importing only public APIs** of other packages.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix This\n\n#### **Option 1: Copy the implementation**\n\nSince `dplyr::closest()` is **not exported**, you **should not use it** directly. Instead, copy the relevant code into your own package (respecting the package license, note attribution if required).\n\n#### **Option 2: Ask the maintainers**\n\nIf this function is critical, you can [open an issue with dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) and request export of `closest()`.\n\n#### **Option 3: Use another public function**\n\nCheck if there’s an **exported equivalent** in dplyr or another package you can use instead.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Copying the function\n\n1.

Never use it in package code.\n\n---\n\n### In summary\n\n- ❌ **Don't:** Rely on non-exported functions from dependencies in package code.\n- ✅ **Do:** Copy internals if necessary (with attribution), or find/use an exported/public alternative.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n- [R Packages: Imports](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html)\n- [Writing R Extensions - Good Practices](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Good-practice)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYou can't do `dplyr::closest()` because it's not exported.  \n**Copy the function to your package** (with credit!) if you need it, or ask dplyr maintainers to export it, or find an alternative.  \n**Do not use `dplyr:::closest()`.**\n\nIf you tell me what you're using `closest()` for, I can help find (or write) a suitable replacement!",
