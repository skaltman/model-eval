We group by ID, and in the summarise we compute two logicals:\n\n 1) any(type == \"Type_II\")  \n 2) among the Type I dates, is there at least one pair within 90 days?\n\nThen we OR them together and coerce to an integer (0/1).  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flag <- df %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_II   = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_I90  = {\n      dI <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      # need at least two Type_I and a gap <= 90 days\n      length(dI) >= 2 && any(diff(sort(dI)) <= 90)\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(flag = as.integer(has_II | has_I90)) %>% \n  select(ID, flag)\n\ndf_flag\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#     ID    flag\n#   <chr> <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key line:\n\n```r\n    has_I90 = {\n      dI <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]        # pull out the Type_I dates\n      length(dI) >= 2 &&                   # need at least two of them\n      any(diff(sort(dI)) <= 90)            # is any consecutive gap ≤ 90 days?\n    }\n```\n\nFinally we combine the two conditions with a logical OR, coerce to integer, and that gives exactly the 0/1 flag you wanted.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Checks for two or more \"Type_I\" entries within 90 days by:\n   - Extracting Type_I dates with `date[type == \"Type_I\"]`\n   - Verifying there are at least 2 Type_I entries\n   - Sorting the dates and checking if any consecutive difference is <= 90 days\n4. Combines these checks with a logical OR\n5. Converts the result to an integer (0/1) flag\n6.

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here is one way to do it in a purely “tidyverse” style.  In essence we\n\n 1. sort the flights into chronological order  \n 2. create a new column `prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)`  \n 3. drop the first row (which has no lag)  \n 4. either  \n    • bin/group by `prev_dep_delay` and compute the mean of `dep_delay`  \n    • or feed the raw `(prev_dep_delay, dep_delay)` pairs into a stat that will compute a moving mean for you  \n\nBelow are two examples.  The first explicitly groups by each distinct lagged‐delay value; the second uses `stat_summary_bin()` to bin the x-axis and plot the mean y in each bin.\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# 1) explicit grouping by exact lag value -----------------------------\nflights %>% \n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%      # make sure rows are in time order\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (min)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of flight departure delays\"\n  )\n\n\n# 2) using stat_summary_bin() to bin the lags --------------------------\nflights %>% \n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  stat_summary_bin(fun = \"mean\", bins = 50, colour = \"red\", size = 1.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (min)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\",\n    title = \"Mean departure delay vs. previous flight’s delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrange(year, month, day, dep_time)` ensures that `lag()` really picks up the immediately preceding flight in time.  \n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` gives you the delay of the flight immediately before each flight.  \n- In the first plot we `group_by(prev_dep_delay)` and then `summarise()` the mean of the current flight’s `dep_delay`.  \n- In the second we leave the raw `(prev_dep_delay, dep_delay)` pairs intact and let `stat_summary_bin()` compute the mean of `dep_delay` within bins of `prev_dep_delay`.  \n\nEither approach will give you a curve showing how the departure delay of the previous flight influences the average delay of the next flight.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

According to the criterion, \"the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport\" and \"the lagged departure delay should be grouped by origin.\"\n\nThe submitted code uses:\n```r\nflights %>% \n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%      # make sure rows are in time order\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n```\n\nWhereas the criterion example uses:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n```\n\nThis is a significant conceptual error because without grouping by origin, the code is looking at the relationship between any consecutive flights in the dataset regardless of airport, which doesn't address the question of how delays propagate within the same airport.\n\nThe submission handles the NA removal appropriately and correctly computes mean departure delays. The visualizations are good, but they're showing the wrong relationship (across all airports rather than within each airport).\n\nGRADE: P"

We first order each origin’s flights by scheduled departure time, compute the lagged delay for the immediately preceding flight, then for each lagged‐delay value compute the mean current delay and plot it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # make sure we only compare within the same airport\n  group_by(origin) %>%                  \n  # order by actual departure time (or scheduled, or time_hour)\n  arrange(time_hour) %>%                \n  # get the previous flight's departure delay\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%  \n  ungroup() %>%                         \n  # drop the first flight for each origin (no prev_dep_delay)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%   \n  # for each value of the previous delay, compute the mean of the current delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%         \n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%              # keep n around for possible weighting/filtering\n  ungroup() %>%                         \n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +             # show raw bins\n  geom_smooth() +                       # add a trend line\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (min)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay (min) of current flight\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of departure delays\"\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `group_by(origin) %>% arrange(time_hour)`: so that lagged delays are only taken within the same airport and in time‐order.  \n2. `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))`: grabs the departure delay of the immediately previous flight.  \n3. `filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay))`: drops the first flight in each group (which has no predecessor).  \n4. `group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>% summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay))`: for each prior‐delay value we compute the average next‐flight delay.  \n5. We then plot mean current delay vs. the previous delay.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

We first pull the previous flight’s departure delay in with `lag()`, drop the `NA` that results for the very first row, then bin or group by the previous‐delay and compute the mean of the current delay.  Finally we plot with ggplot2.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>% \n  # grab the delay of the immediate predecessor\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>% \n  # drop the first row (it has no predecessor)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>% \n  # (option A) group by the raw previous delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>% \n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(prev_dep_delay, mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"steelblue\") +\n    scale_size_area(max_size = 5) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\",\n      size = \"Count\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nIf you find the raw scatter too noisy, you can first bin the previous‐delay into e.g. 10-minute buckets:\n\n```r\nflights %>% \n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>% \n  # bin into 10-minute intervals\n  mutate(bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-60, 300, by = 10))) %>% \n  group_by(bin) %>% \n  summarise(\n    prev_mid   = mean(prev_dep_delay),\n    mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n          = n()\n  ) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(prev_mid, mean_delay)) +\n    geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_line(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Mid‐point of previous delay bin (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nEither approach will clearly show the positive correlation between a flight’s delay and the delay of the flight immediately before it."

Finally we plot with ggplot2.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>% \n  # grab the delay of the immediate predecessor\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>% \n  # drop the first row (it has no predecessor)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>% \n  # (option A) group by the raw previous delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>% \n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(prev_dep_delay, mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"steelblue\") +\n    scale_size_area(max_size = 5) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\",\n      size = \"Count\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nIf you find the raw scatter too noisy, you can first bin the previous‐delay into e.g. 10-minute buckets:\n\n```r\nflights %>% \n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>% \n  # bin into 10-minute intervals\n  mutate(bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-60, 300, by = 10))) %>% \n  group_by(bin) %>% \n  summarise(\n    prev_mid   = mean(prev_dep_delay),\n    mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n          = n()\n  ) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(prev_mid, mean_delay)) +\n    geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_line(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Mid‐point of previous delay bin (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nEither approach will clearly show the positive correlation between a flight’s delay and the delay of the flight immediately before it.",

In the first solution (changing to POST), they explicitly include `req_method(\"POST\")` in their code example:\n```r\nrequest(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  ...\n```\n\n2.

Technically, in the second solution, they could have included `req_method(\"GET\")` for clarity, but it's not required since GET is the default method in httr2.\n\nThe author has correctly addressed the underlying problem, which was not about a missing method declaration but about incorrectly trying to send a body with a GET request.

HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed\n\nHow do I fix it?\n***\n[Submission]: The problem is not in httr2 per‐se but in the fact that you are issuing a GET and at the same time trying to shove a JSON body into it.  Most HTTP servers will reject a GET that has a body, or simply aren’t wired to handle it – hence the 405 “Method Not Allowed.”\n\nYou have two obvious remedies:\n\n  1. If the API really wants you to POST a JSON payload, switch your verb to POST.  \n  2. If the API really is a GET, then push your parameters into the URL (either via query‐string or path) and don’t send a JSON body.\n\n---\n\n1) Change to POST  \n\nCurl  \n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n    \"fechaFinal\":  \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\nhttr2  \n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nresp <- request(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    Accept       = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey       = \"xxxxxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(list(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nresp\n```\n\n---\n\n2) Keep it GET, use URL query  \n\nCurl  \n```bash\ncurl -G \\\n  'https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'id=5' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaInicial=2023-02-01' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaFinal=2023-05-01'\n```\n\nNote the use of `-G` (turns data into query parameters) and the removal of the JSON body.\n\nhttr2  \n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nresp <- request(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    Accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nresp\n```\n\n---\n\nA couple of extra tips:\n\n• Double-check the API docs to see whether that endpoint wants GET or POST.  \n• In your R code you named the object `one2 <- ...` but then you call `cone2 %>% req_perform()`.  That typo means you weren’t even calling the request you built.  \n\nOnce you’ve matched the correct verb and parameter style (body vs. query), the 405 should go away.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

They provide two solutions:\n\n1. In the first solution (changing to POST), they explicitly include `req_method(\"POST\")` in their code example:\n```r\nrequest(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  ...\n```\n\n2. In the second solution (keeping it GET but using URL query parameters), they don't explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")` because GET is the default method in httr2, and they're using `req_url_query()` instead of sending a body.\n\nThe criteria specifically asks if there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the code. Technically, in the second solution, they could have included `req_method(\"GET\")` for clarity, but it's not required since GET is the default method in httr2.\n\nThe author has correctly addressed the underlying problem, which was not about a missing method declaration but about incorrectly trying to send a body with a GET request. The second solution keeps the method as GET (implicitly) and changes the way parameters are sent.\n\nGRADE: P"

If the API really is a GET, then push your parameters into the URL (either via query‐string or path) and don’t send a JSON body.\n\n---\n\n1) Change to POST  \n\nCurl  \n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n    \"fechaFinal\":  \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\nhttr2  \n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nresp <- request(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    Accept       = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey       = \"xxxxxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(list(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nresp\n```\n\n---\n\n2) Keep it GET, use URL query  \n\nCurl  \n```bash\ncurl -G \\\n  'https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'id=5' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaInicial=2023-02-01' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaFinal=2023-05-01'\n```\n\nNote the use of `-G` (turns data into query parameters) and the removal of the JSON body.\n\nhttr2  \n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nresp <- request(\"https://api.yourservice.com/your‐endpoint\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    Accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nresp\n```\n\n---\n\nA couple of extra tips:\n\n• Double-check the API docs to see whether that endpoint wants GET or POST.  \n• In your R code you named the object `one2 <- ...` but then you call `cone2 %>% req_perform()`.  That typo means you weren’t even calling the request you built.  \n\nOnce you’ve matched the correct verb and parameter style (body vs. query), the 405 should go away.",

You can do that in one of two (really three) ways:\n\n1) map a constant shape (and/or size) in your geom so that ggplot knows “even the unused levels should be drawn as these dots”  \n2) leave your geom alone but use `guide_legend(override.aes=…)` to force a point glyph in every key  \n3) (equivalently) add a tiny dummy row for “d” to your data (I find this a bit ugly so I prefer 1 or 2)\n\nHere are two complete examples.\n\n## 1) Just give geom_point a constant shape (and size)\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels=letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z)) +\n  geom_point(shape=19, size=3) +        # <- here: fixed solid circle\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"),\n    breaks = levels(df$z)               # make sure 'd' is in the legend\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nBecause you have told `geom_point()` to *always* use `shape=19` (a solid circle) and `size=3`, the legend knows exactly how to draw *every* key, even “d”.\n\n## 2) Use `override.aes` on the legend\n\nIf you’d rather not change your geoms you can leave `geom_point()` alone and tell the legend how to draw each key:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"),\n    breaks = levels(df$z)\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    colour = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(shape=19, size=3)\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nAgain we use `breaks=levels(df$z)` to be explicit about the order and inclusion of “d”, and `override.aes` to force each key in the legend to be a solid circle of the right colour.\n\nEither approach will give you a green dot next to “d” in your legend.",

For example, if you want all of your keys to be solid circles, you can do:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,           # keep the unused level in the legend\n    values = c(\n      a = \"red\",\n      b = \"blue\",\n      c = \"yellow\",\n      d = \"green\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    color = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(\n        shape = 16,            # solid circle\n        size  = 3,             # whatever size you like\n        alpha = 1              # make sure it's not transparent\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nWhat’s happening here is:\n\n1.  `drop = FALSE` tells the scale to keep “d” in the legend even though it doesn’t appear in the data.\n2.  By default ggplot “blanks out” any legend key that has no data (it sets α = 0). \n3.  `override.aes` lets you override that, so you give it a solid shape, non‐zero alpha, etc., and now “d” gets a green dot just like the others.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Most HTTP client libraries (including curl under the hood) will refuse to call a URL like\n\n   https://…/search?q=Prince st., New York 10012&api_key=…\n\nbecause it isn’t valid percent-encoded UTF-8.\n\nYou have two easy fixes:\n\n1) Manually percent-encode the address with URLencode() or curl::curl_escape().  \n2) Use httr2’s req_url_query() helper which will encode for you.\n\n## 1) Manual encoding\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\nekey    <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# percent-encode spaces, commas, etc\naddress_esc <- curl::curl_escape(address)\n\nurl <- glue::glue(\n  \"https://geocode.maps.co/search?\",\n  \"q={address_esc}&api_key={ekey}\"\n)\n\nresp <- httr2::request(url) %>% \n  httr2::req_perform() %>% \n  httr2::resp_body_json()\n```\n\nNow your final URL will look like:\n\n```\nhttps://geocode.maps.co/search?q=Prince%20st.%2C%20New%20York%2010012&api_key=my_secret_api_key\n```\n\n## 2) Using req_url_query()\n\nhttr2 has a built-in way to add query parameters and percent-encode them for you:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\nekey    <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nresp <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    q       = address,\n    api_key = ekey\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform() %>%\n  resp_body_json()\n\n# You can then inspect resp:\nprint(resp)\n```\n\nUnder the hood req_url_query( q = address ) will take care of turning `\"Prince st., New York 10012\"` into the proper `%20` and `%2C`.\n\n---\n\n**Bonus**: The maps.co geocoder actually does not require an API key. You can omit `api_key` entirely and just do:\n\n```r\nresp <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>% \n  req_url_query(q = address) %>% \n  req_perform() %>% \n  resp_body_json()\n```\n\nThat will give you a JSON array of matches.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion provided, which suggests specific changes to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe submission proposes a more complex solution that adds a special case for discrete scales in the `init` function. While this solution would work, it does not match the simpler approach suggested in the criterion. \n\nThe criterion proposes just two changes:\n1. Adding `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` instead of just `scale$get_breaks()` in one section\n2. Adding a `setNames()` call to preserve break names in another section with `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach by:\n1. Adding a whole new section of code specifically for discrete scales\n2. Deriving or fetching breaks\n3. Creating a custom label function when breaks have names\n4. Setting up guide derivation\n5. Using an early return to skip continuous logic\n\nWhile the submission would likely work, it is more complicated than necessary and doesn't follow the specific, minimal changes requested in the criterion. The criterion provides a more elegant solution that simply preserves the names throughout the existing code path.\n\nGRADE: I",

The trick is to short‐circuit the generic continuous‐scale logic in `AxisSecondary$init()` whenever the underlying scale is discrete, and in that branch, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, set `self$labels` to return `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+    # SPECIAL CASE FOR DISCRETE SCALES\n+    # If the primary scale is discrete, grab the breaks,\n+    # and if they have names, turn those names into the labels.\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # 1) derive or fetch the breaks\n+      if (is.derived(self$breaks) || is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n+        # scale$get_breaks() will compute the actual discrete values\n+        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+      }\n+\n+      # 2) derive the labels\n+      if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        brk_names <- names(self$breaks)\n+        if (!is.null(brk_names)) {\n+          # turn names into a labels‐function so that\n+          # guide_axis() will pick them up as labels\n+          self$labels <- function(x) brk_names\n+        } else {\n+          # fall back to the primary scale's label function\n+          self$labels <- scale$labels\n+        }\n+      }\n+\n+      # 3) derive the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # we've done all the discrete work, skip the continuous logic\n+      return()\n+    }\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n@@\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n1.  Right after checking for an “empty” secondary axis, it asks  \n    ```r\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }\n    ```\n2.  Inside that block:\n    - It either **derives** or **fetches** the actual discrete break values with `scale$get_breaks()`.\n    - If those breaks have names (`names(self$breaks) != NULL`) **and** the user has not explicitly supplied `labels`, then we install\n      ```r\n      self$labels <- function(x) names(self$breaks)\n      ```\n      so that when the guide is drawn, the names become the printed labels.\n    - If there are no names on the break vector we fall back to `scale$labels`, i.e. whatever the primary scale would have used.\n    - We also “derive” the guide if it was requested.\n3.  We `return()` immediately so that none of the continuous‐scale init logic afterwards ever runs.\n\nWith this in place, you can do something like:\n\n```r\nsf <- c(a = 1, b = 3, c = 5)\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 2,\n                        breaks = sf)\n  )\n```\n\nand on the secondary axis you will see the labels “a”, “b” and “c” rather than just `\"1\"`, `\"3\"`, `\"5\"`.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Adding `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` instead of just `scale$get_breaks()` in one section\n2. Adding a `setNames()` call to preserve break names in another section with `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach by:\n1. Adding a whole new section of code specifically for discrete scales\n2. Deriving or fetching breaks\n3. Creating a custom label function when breaks have names\n4. Setting up guide derivation\n5. Using an early return to skip continuous logic\n\nWhile the submission would likely work, it is more complicated than necessary and doesn't follow the specific, minimal changes requested in the criterion.

The trick is to short‐circuit the generic continuous‐scale logic in `AxisSecondary$init()` whenever the underlying scale is discrete, and in that branch, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, set `self$labels` to return `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+    # SPECIAL CASE FOR DISCRETE SCALES\n+    # If the primary scale is discrete, grab the breaks,\n+    # and if they have names, turn those names into the labels.\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # 1) derive or fetch the breaks\n+      if (is.derived(self$breaks) || is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n+        # scale$get_breaks() will compute the actual discrete values\n+        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+      }\n+\n+      # 2) derive the labels\n+      if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        brk_names <- names(self$breaks)\n+        if (!is.null(brk_names)) {\n+          # turn names into a labels‐function so that\n+          # guide_axis() will pick them up as labels\n+          self$labels <- function(x) brk_names\n+        } else {\n+          # fall back to the primary scale's label function\n+          self$labels <- scale$labels\n+        }\n+      }\n+\n+      # 3) derive the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # we've done all the discrete work, skip the continuous logic\n+      return()\n+    }\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n@@\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n1.  Right after checking for an “empty” secondary axis, it asks  \n    ```r\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }\n    ```\n2.  Inside that block:\n    - It either **derives** or **fetches** the actual discrete break values with `scale$get_breaks()`.\n    - If those breaks have names (`names(self$breaks) != NULL`) **and** the user has not explicitly supplied `labels`, then we install\n      ```r\n      self$labels <- function(x) names(self$breaks)\n      ```\n      so that when the guide is drawn, the names become the printed labels.\n    - If there are no names on the break vector we fall back to `scale$labels`, i.e. whatever the primary scale would have used.\n    - We also “derive” the guide if it was requested.\n3.  We `return()` immediately so that none of the continuous‐scale init logic afterwards ever runs.\n\nWith this in place, you can do something like:\n\n```r\nsf <- c(a = 1, b = 3, c = 5)\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 2,\n                        breaks = sf)\n  )\n```\n\nand on the secondary axis you will see the labels “a”, “b” and “c” rather than just `\"1\"`, `\"3\"`, `\"5\"`."

The trick is to short‐circuit the generic continuous‐scale logic in `AxisSecondary$init()` whenever the underlying scale is discrete, and in that branch, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, set `self$labels` to return `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+    # SPECIAL CASE FOR DISCRETE SCALES\n+    # If the primary scale is discrete, grab the breaks,\n+    # and if they have names, turn those names into the labels.\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # 1) derive or fetch the breaks\n+      if (is.derived(self$breaks) || is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n+        # scale$get_breaks() will compute the actual discrete values\n+        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+      }\n+\n+      # 2) derive the labels\n+      if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        brk_names <- names(self$breaks)\n+        if (!is.null(brk_names)) {\n+          # turn names into a labels‐function so that\n+          # guide_axis() will pick them up as labels\n+          self$labels <- function(x) brk_names\n+        } else {\n+          # fall back to the primary scale's label function\n+          self$labels <- scale$labels\n+        }\n+      }\n+\n+      # 3) derive the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # we've done all the discrete work, skip the continuous logic\n+      return()\n+    }\n+    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n@@\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n1.  Right after checking for an “empty” secondary axis, it asks  \n    ```r\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }\n    ```\n2.  Inside that block:\n    - It either **derives** or **fetches** the actual discrete break values with `scale$get_breaks()`.\n    - If those breaks have names (`names(self$breaks) != NULL`) **and** the user has not explicitly supplied `labels`, then we install\n      ```r\n      self$labels <- function(x) names(self$breaks)\n      ```\n      so that when the guide is drawn, the names become the printed labels.\n    - If there are no names on the break vector we fall back to `scale$labels`, i.e. whatever the primary scale would have used.\n    - We also “derive” the guide if it was requested.\n3.  We `return()` immediately so that none of the continuous‐scale init logic afterwards ever runs.\n\nWith this in place, you can do something like:\n\n```r\nsf <- c(a = 1, b = 3, c = 5)\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 2,\n                        breaks = sf)\n  )\n```\n\nand on the secondary axis you will see the labels “a”, “b” and “c” rather than just `\"1\"`, `\"3\"`, `\"5\"`.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion of implementing a solution that allows discrete breaks with names to be used as labels by default in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion suggests a two-part modification:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting breaks for discrete scales\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names when mapping breaks\n\nThe submitted solution takes a different approach. Instead of modifying how breaks are handled, it adds code to the `set_sec_axis()` function to:\n1. Check if we're on a discrete primary scale and the user hasn't set labels explicitly\n2. Get primary breaks and extract their names\n3. If names exist, apply them as labels for the secondary axis\n\nWhile the solution is different than the suggested one in the criterion, it addresses the same underlying issue - it ensures that named discrete breaks will be used as labels on the secondary axis. However, it doesn't directly implement the specific code changes outlined in the criterion.\n\nThe submission handles the issue at a different point in the process (in `set_sec_axis()` rather than in the `AxisSecondary` initialization), and it copies names to labels rather than preserving names in the breaks themselves.\n\nGRADE: P",

We simply catch the case where the primary scale is discrete, the user hasn’t supplied any explicit `labels` to `sec_axis()`, and the primary breaks have names.  In that case we pull off those names and install them as the secondary axis labels.\n\nIn your `set_sec_axis()` function, add the following block right after the `scale$is_discrete()` check:\n\n```r\nset_sec_axis <- function(sec.axis, scale) {\n  if (!is.waiver(sec.axis)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      if (!identical(.subset2(sec.axis, \"trans\"), identity)) {\n        cli::cli_abort(\"Discrete secondary axes must have the {.fn identity} transformation.\")\n      }\n\n      # ←– HERE IS THE NEW BIT –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n      # If the user didn't explicitly set sec.axis$labels, and the\n      # primary breaks have names, use those names as the default labels\n      if (is.waiver(sec.axis$labels)) {\n        pk <- scale$get_breaks()\n        nm <- names(pk)\n        if (!is.null(nm)) {\n          sec.axis$labels <- nm\n        }\n      }\n      # ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n    }\n    if (is.formula(sec.axis)) sec.axis <- sec_axis(sec.axis)\n    if (!is.sec_axis(sec.axis)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Secondary axes must be specified using {.fn sec_axis}.\")\n    }\n    scale$secondary.axis <- sec.axis\n  }\n  scale\n}\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n 1.  After confirming we’re on a discrete primary scale (and after verifying the transform is `identity`), we check whether the user has left `sec.axis$labels` at the default `waiver()`.\n 2.  If so, we pull the primary breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  If *those* breaks have a `names()` attribute, we adopt those names as the secondary axis labels.\n 3.  From thereon the normal machinery for drawing the secondary axis will use our newly injected `sec.axis$labels` vector.\n\nWith this one small change, any named discrete breaks on your primary scale will automatically turn into the labels on the secondary axis.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

We simply catch the case where the primary scale is discrete, the user hasn’t supplied any explicit `labels` to `sec_axis()`, and the primary breaks have names.  In that case we pull off those names and install them as the secondary axis labels.\n\nIn your `set_sec_axis()` function, add the following block right after the `scale$is_discrete()` check:\n\n```r\nset_sec_axis <- function(sec.axis, scale) {\n  if (!is.waiver(sec.axis)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      if (!identical(.subset2(sec.axis, \"trans\"), identity)) {\n        cli::cli_abort(\"Discrete secondary axes must have the {.fn identity} transformation.\")\n      }\n\n      # ←– HERE IS THE NEW BIT –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n      # If the user didn't explicitly set sec.axis$labels, and the\n      # primary breaks have names, use those names as the default labels\n      if (is.waiver(sec.axis$labels)) {\n        pk <- scale$get_breaks()\n        nm <- names(pk)\n        if (!is.null(nm)) {\n          sec.axis$labels <- nm\n        }\n      }\n      # ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n    }\n    if (is.formula(sec.axis)) sec.axis <- sec_axis(sec.axis)\n    if (!is.sec_axis(sec.axis)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Secondary axes must be specified using {.fn sec_axis}.\")\n    }\n    scale$secondary.axis <- sec.axis\n  }\n  scale\n}\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n 1.  After confirming we’re on a discrete primary scale (and after verifying the transform is `identity`), we check whether the user has left `sec.axis$labels` at the default `waiver()`.\n 2.  If so, we pull the primary breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  If *those* breaks have a `names()` attribute, we adopt those names as the secondary axis labels.\n 3.  From thereon the normal machinery for drawing the secondary axis will use our newly injected `sec.axis$labels` vector.\n\nWith this one small change, any named discrete breaks on your primary scale will automatically turn into the labels on the secondary axis."

We simply catch the case where the primary scale is discrete, the user hasn’t supplied any explicit `labels` to `sec_axis()`, and the primary breaks have names.  In that case we pull off those names and install them as the secondary axis labels.\n\nIn your `set_sec_axis()` function, add the following block right after the `scale$is_discrete()` check:\n\n```r\nset_sec_axis <- function(sec.axis, scale) {\n  if (!is.waiver(sec.axis)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      if (!identical(.subset2(sec.axis, \"trans\"), identity)) {\n        cli::cli_abort(\"Discrete secondary axes must have the {.fn identity} transformation.\")\n      }\n\n      # ←– HERE IS THE NEW BIT –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n      # If the user didn't explicitly set sec.axis$labels, and the\n      # primary breaks have names, use those names as the default labels\n      if (is.waiver(sec.axis$labels)) {\n        pk <- scale$get_breaks()\n        nm <- names(pk)\n        if (!is.null(nm)) {\n          sec.axis$labels <- nm\n        }\n      }\n      # ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n    }\n    if (is.formula(sec.axis)) sec.axis <- sec_axis(sec.axis)\n    if (!is.sec_axis(sec.axis)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Secondary axes must be specified using {.fn sec_axis}.\")\n    }\n    scale$secondary.axis <- sec.axis\n  }\n  scale\n}\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n 1.  After confirming we’re on a discrete primary scale (and after verifying the transform is `identity`), we check whether the user has left `sec.axis$labels` at the default `waiver()`.\n 2.  If so, we pull the primary breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  If *those* breaks have a `names()` attribute, we adopt those names as the secondary axis labels.\n 3.  From thereon the normal machinery for drawing the secondary axis will use our newly injected `sec.axis$labels` vector.\n\nWith this one small change, any named discrete breaks on your primary scale will automatically turn into the labels on the secondary axis.",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

Right after that block (and *before* you fall back to deriving `self$labels` from the primary scale) insert something like this:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n\n    ## inherit name if requested\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) {\n      self$name <- scale$name\n    }\n\n    ## inherit breaks if requested\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    }\n\n    ## default breaks if still a waiver()\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        ## … the rest of your continuous‐break logic …\n      }\n    }\n\n    ## ——— NEW BLOCK STARTS HERE ———\n    ## If this is a discrete secondary axis, the user supplied\n    ## a *named* numeric/vector of breaks, and they have not supplied\n    ## custom labels, then use those names as the labels.\n    if (scale$is_discrete() &&\n        is.atomic(self$breaks) &&\n        !is.function(self$breaks) &&\n        is.waiver(self$labels) &&\n        !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n\n      ## grab the values (unnamed) and their names\n      brk_vals  <- unname(self$breaks)\n      brk_names <- names(self$breaks)\n\n      ## replace self$breaks with the plain (unnamed) vector\n      self$breaks <- brk_vals\n\n      ## build a small labeling function that will look up the name\n      ## for each break value.\n      self$labels <- function(x) {\n        brk_names[ match(x, brk_vals) ]\n      }\n    }\n    ## ——— NEW BLOCK ENDS HERE ———\n\n    ## now fall back to deriving labels or guides if requested\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n      self$guide <- scale$guide\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nWhat this does:\n\n1.  Detects a discrete secondary axis (`scale$is_discrete()`), with a *plain named* vector in `sec.axis = sec_axis(..., breaks = c(A = 1, B = 2, C = 4))`, and with `labels` still at the default `waiver()`.\n2.

Use `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` instead of just `scale$map(self$breaks)` to preserve names when mapping the breaks.\n\nThe submission, on the other hand, provides a much more complex solution that:\n1.

Creates a new labeling function that maps breaks back to their names\n\nWhile the submission's approach would likely work, it's significantly more complex than necessary. The criterion provides a more elegant solution that simply preserves the names throughout the existing workflow, without needing to create special labeling functions.\n\nThe criterion's solution focuses on preserving names when manipulating break values, which is a more direct approach to solving the stated problem.

          "explanation": "I'll assess the submission against the criterion provided.\n\nThe submission follows the necessary steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. It filters out flights with missing tail numbers using `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`, which is acceptable according to the criterion.\n\n2. It groups by `tailnum` using `group_by(tailnum)`.\n\n3. It computes the summary statistics correctly:\n   - Counts the total flights per tailnum with `n()`\n   - Calculates the proportion of missing arrival delays with `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which is the correct method according to the criterion.\n\n4. It filters to only keep tailnums with at least 100 flights using `filter(n >= 100)`. This approach differs from the criterion's suggestion of using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or the group_by + filter combination, but achieves the same result for this problem.\n\n5. It finds the tailnum with the highest proportion using `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`, which effectively accomplishes the same task as `arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))` followed by selecting the first row.\n\nWhile the implementation details differ slightly from those described in the criterion (using a different approach to find rows with at least 100 flights and using slice_max instead of arrange + slice), the submission correctly solves the stated problem of finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nGRADE: C",

It\n\n1. Drops flights with no tail‐number  \n2. Groups by `tailnum`  \n3. Computes total flights `n` and the proportion of missing `arr_delay`  \n4. Filters to those with at least 100 flights  \n5. Picks the tailnum with the highest missing‐rate  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%               # drop flights without a tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%                     \n  summarise(\n    n         = n(),                        # total flights\n    prop_na   = mean(is.na(arr_delay))      # % of flights with NA arrival delay\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%                      # require at least 100 flights\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)                 # pick the one with highest prop_na\n```\n\nIf you want to see the top 5 “worst” tailnums, for example, you can replace the last line with:\n\n```r\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 5)\n```\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It filters out flights with missing tail numbers using `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`, which is acceptable according to the criterion.\n\n2. It groups by `tailnum` using `group_by(tailnum)`.\n\n3. It computes the summary statistics correctly:\n   - Counts the total flights per tailnum with `n()`\n   - Calculates the proportion of missing arrival delays with `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which is the correct method according to the criterion.\n\n4. It filters to only keep tailnums with at least 100 flights using `filter(n >= 100)`. This approach differs from the criterion's suggestion of using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or the group_by + filter combination, but achieves the same result for this problem.\n\n5. It finds the tailnum with the highest proportion using `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`, which effectively accomplishes the same task as `arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))` followed by selecting the first row.\n\nWhile the implementation details differ slightly from those described in the criterion (using a different approach to find rows with at least 100 flights and using slice_max instead of arrange + slice), the submission correctly solves the stated problem of finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nGRADE: C"

For example:\n\n  library(ggplot2)\n  \n  ggplot(mydata, aes(x = factor, y = value)) +\n    geom_jitter(width  = 0.2,   # how far to jitter in x\n                height = 0)     # no jitter in y\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n  ggplot(mydata, aes(x = factor, y = value)) +\n    geom_point(position = position_jitter(width  = 0.2,\n                                         height = 0))\n\nThat will smear your x‐values by up to ±0.2 (or whatever you choose) but leave the y’s exactly where they are.\n***\n[Criterion]: Either set `geom_jitter(height = 0)` or `geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Set `name = NULL` by default, then use `substitute(dataset)` inside the function body to capture the unevaluated expression and assign it to `name` if `name` is NULL.\n\n2. Use `match.call()` to get the original call and extract the dataset parameter name.\n\n3. Use rlang's tidy evaluation tools with `enquo()` and `as_name()`.\n\nWhile these are all valid approaches to solve the original problem, they do not directly address the specific criterion that `name` must be evaluated early using `force(name)`. Instead, they change the default value of `name` and implement different ways to capture the symbol.\n\nThe core issue is correctly identified (lazy evaluation), but the specific solution approach mentioned in the criterion (using `force(name)`) is not used or mentioned in the submission.\n\nGRADE: P"

Setting `name = NULL` as the default (rather than using `deparse(substitute(dataset))` directly in the parameter list)\n2. Checking if `name` is null within the function body\n3. Using `substitute(dataset)` inside the function body if needed\n\nThis approach ensures that the substitution happens at the correct time within the function's execution, when `dataset` still refers to the unevaluated argument expression.\n\nThe submission also offers an alternative using rlang helpers, which is semantically equivalent.\n\nHowever, the submission does not explicitly mention using `force(name)` to ensure early evaluation of the name parameter, which was specifically mentioned in the criterion. While the proposed solution works correctly, it doesn't explicitly address the specific technique mentioned in the criterion.\n\nThat said, I should note that the solution provided does implicitly handle the evaluation order issue - by checking `is.null(name)` early in the function, it effectively ensures `name` is evaluated before proceeding with other operations. So functionally the solution addresses the underlying problem even without using `force()` explicitly.\n\nGRADE: P",

The submission explains that this resulted in IDs like \"inner1-someTextGenerated\" when they should actually be \"outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated\" due to the nested module structure.\n\nThe solution provided matches exactly what the criterion specifies - replacing `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` inside the moduleServer function. Using `session$ns` ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nThe submission includes a working example with the fix implemented, and clearly explains both the cause of the problem and the solution.

In your `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` do something like\n     uses: r-lib/actions/pkgdown@v4\n     with:\n       r_dependency_resolver: remotes\n\n   This will honour your Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff entry and succeed.\n\n2) Pre-install your GitHub dependency yourself  \n   Simply add a step before the pkgdown build to install “spatialstuff” from GitHub.  For example:\n     \n     - name: Install spatialstuff from GitHub\n       run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n\n   Once that package is in the library, the pak step inside pkgdown will see it and things will proceed normally.\n\nFinally, if you want to track the underlying issue, feel free to open an issue on https://github.com/r-lib/pak – they’ll want to handle the case where the repo name (with a dash and mixed case) doesn’t match the lower-case Package: field.\n\nHope that helps!",

In consequence it never even tries to go to GitHub, it just looks on CRAN for a package called `spatialstuff` and dies.\n\nYou have two choices:\n\n1)  Fully qualify the GitHub remote (which _does_ get picked up properly by `pak`).  In your `DESCRIPTION` change\n\n    Remotes:\n      org/spatial-Stuff\n\n   to\n\n    Remotes:\n      github::org/spatial-Stuff@main\n\n   (or whatever ref/branch/tag you need).  Now `pak` will see “github::…” and actually clone that repo before trying to install `spatialstuff`.\n\n2)  Or install your spatial‐stuff dependency _before_ you call pkgdown in your GitHub Actions workflow.  For example, in your `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` add a step like\n\n    - name: install spatial-stuff\n      run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n\n   immediately before the “Install dependencies” or “Build site” steps.\n\nEither of those work-arounds will unblock you today.  In the long run it’s worth filing an issue against the `pak` project so that hyphenated repo names in `Remotes:` just work automatically."

When you do\n\n  Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n    \"Parent\",\n    lock_objects = FALSE,\n    public = list(\n      initialize = function() {\n        self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() { print(\"foo\") }\n      }\n    )\n  )\n\nyou never had a foo in the prototype so the first time you call initialize() there is nothing to be locked and your self[[\"foo\"]] <- … works fine.  But as soon as you inherit from Parent _and_ you give Child a foo of its own:\n\n  Child <- R6::R6Class(\n    \"Child\",\n    inherit = Parent,\n    lock_objects = FALSE,\n    public = list(\n      foo = function() {\n        super$foo()\n      }\n    )\n  )\n\nthe moment you do Child$new() we\n\n  1. build the object\n  2. bind _and lock_ foo ← your child version into it\n  3. run initialize(), which still tries to do self[[\"foo\"]] <- …  \n     → boom, foo is a locked binding now.\n\nThe cure is therefore either\n\n1) **Don’t dynamically create your methods in initialize**.  If you know you are going to need a foo, put it in Parent’s public list:\n\n     Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n       \"Parent\",\n       lock_objects = FALSE,\n       public = list(\n         foo = function() {\n           print(\"foo\")\n         }\n       )\n     )\n\n   Then Child can simply override foo in its public list without ever touching initialize().\n\n2) **Or**, if for some reason you really must generate foo at run time in initialize, you have to unlock the old binding, assign, and optionally re‐lock it:\n\n     Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n       \"Parent\",\n       lock_objects = FALSE,\n       public = list(\n         initialize = function() {\n           # if foo already exists and is locked, unlock it\n           if (\"foo\" %in% ls(self, all.names=TRUE) &&\n               bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n             unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n           }\n           # now assign your new foo\n           self$foo <- function() {\n             print(\"foo\")\n           }\n           # if you still want to lock it afterward\n           lockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n         }\n       )\n     )\n\n   Now if Child has overridden foo in its public list, you will unlock the child’s foo, replace it, and can even re‐lock it if you like.\n\nBut by far the simplest and most idiomatic R6 solution is to _define_ all of your methods in the public list (or private list) so that they can be overridden in subclasses in the usual way, and only use initialize() for setting up fields/values that really do need to be instance‐specific.",

For example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# load your data once, in the global scope\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\",\n                   \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # reactives must live inside server\n  ckd_condition <- reactive({\n    input$condition\n  })\n\n  visit_threshold <- reactive({\n    input$visit_threshold\n  })\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(),\n        VISIT_COUNT >  visit_threshold()\n      )\n  })\n\n  # define output$plot *inside* the server\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\",       \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0,    \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n\n    data <- filtered_data()\n\n    # build the lm and the ggplot\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n1.  Anything that refers to `input`, `output`, or `session` must live *inside* the `server` function.\n2.  You must assign to `output$plot <- renderPlot({ … })` inside your `server`.  Just writing `output$plot` in the server body does nothing.\n3.  Your final call is `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`, not an anonymous server that never populates `output$plot`.\n\nOnce you make that change your app will find `output$plot` and the error will disappear.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies the problem with the server function and proposes a proper solution that meets the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies that the error is happening because the original code has `output$plot` alone in the server function without actually defining it:\n```r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n  output$plot\n})\n```\n\nThe submission properly explains that:\n1. The `output$plot` definition is in the global scope, not in the server function\n2. The server function is only trying to return the value of `output$plot` rather than defining it\n3. The reactives need to be inside the server function\n\nThe solution provided in the submission shows:\n1. Moving the reactive expressions and `renderPlot` code inside the server function\n2. Properly assigning to `output$plot` with the renderPlot expression\n3. Additional improvements like using `req()` function and better code organization\n\nThis matches the core solution in the criterion, which also shows the same key fixes: moving the reactive definitions and the `output$plot <- renderPlot(...)` assignment inside the server function.\n\nWhile the submission's solution includes some additional changes (using `req()`, adding more validation, and restructuring some code), these are enhancements that don't contradict the core solution required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

A minimal working example would look like this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# load your data once, globally\nKidney_Correlations_Data <-\n  read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\",\n                  \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\",\n                   \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5,\n                   min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # reactive subset\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)  # make sure they exist\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n\n  # render the plot\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    df <- filtered_data()\n\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(df) > 1, \"Not enough data points to fit a model\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold >= 0, \"Threshold must be non‐negative\")\n    )\n\n    ggplot(df, aes(VISIT_COUNT, Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n  1.  Everything that refers to `input` or `output` must live inside the `server` function.  \n  2.  You assign `output$plot <- renderPlot({ … })` inside the server – you don’t *return* `output$plot`, you *define* it.  \n  3.  Use `req()` or `validate()` + `need()` to guard against missing or invalid inputs.  \n\nOnce you reorganize your code so that all reactives and your `renderPlot` are in `server`, and you actually assign to `output$plot` there, the “Can’t read output ‘plot’” error will go away.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The `output$plot` definition is in the global scope, not in the server function\n2. The server function is only trying to return the value of `output$plot` rather than defining it\n3. The reactives need to be inside the server function\n\nThe solution provided in the submission shows:\n1. Moving the reactive expressions and `renderPlot` code inside the server function\n2. Properly assigning to `output$plot` with the renderPlot expression\n3. Additional improvements like using `req()` function and better code organization\n\nThis matches the core solution in the criterion, which also shows the same key fixes: moving the reactive definitions and the `output$plot <- renderPlot(...)` assignment inside the server function.\n\nWhile the submission's solution includes some additional changes (using `req()`, adding more validation, and restructuring some code), these are enhancements that don't contradict the core solution required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

The cure is to switch to exact‐matching extraction via `[[` on the right‐hand side:\n\n```diff\n token_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n   out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n     client,\n     grant_type    = \"refresh_token\",\n     refresh_token = refresh_token,\n     scope         = scope,\n     !!!token_params\n   )\n-  out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n+  # use [[ ]] for exact matching on the RHS to avoid matching\n+  # refresh_token_expires_in by mistake\n+  out$refresh_token <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n   out\n }\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1.  On the RHS we now do `out[[\"refresh_token\"]]` which, unlike `out$refresh_token`, will *only* look for an exact `\"refresh_token\"` name and will return `NULL` if it isn’t there (no warning, no partial match).  \n2.  The LHS `out$refresh_token <-` will still *assign* exactly a `\"refresh_token\"` field, overwriting or creating it as needed.  \n\nThat small change removes the partial‐match warning and gives you exactly the behaviour you expect.\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`.

Second solution uses `separate()` and `paste0()` rather than `str_replace()` twice.\n\nThe first solution perfectly meets the criterion by calling `str_replace()` twice in order, exactly as required. The fact that it assigns to `result` rather than `appointment_key` is explicitly allowed in the criterion. The solution correctly uses `fixed()` which is also explicitly allowed.\n\nGRADE: C"

Of course you can simplify the backtick‐escaping in your string if you like—backticks aren’t special in R strings:\n\n```r\nexpect_warning(\n  check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\",\n                 exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n  regexp = \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n)\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you’d rather go the snapshot‐route (which is encouraged for longer messages or if you expect the text to change over time) you can also write:\n\n```r\nexpect_snapshot_warning(\n  check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\",\n                 exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE)\n)\n```\n\nand let testthat record the exact warning text in a snapshot.\n***\n[Criterion]: Instead of the regex, test the warning message with a snapshot:\n\n```\nexpect_snapshot(\n  .res <- check_ellipses(\n    \"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE\n  )\n)\n```\n\nAssigning to some intermediate value like `.res <- ` is nice as it prevents the result from being inlined into the snapshot. The call to `check_ellipses()` itself should stay exactly the same.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

That will remove both the “not exported” errors and the linter complaints.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
