This repository contains the code for the accompanying blog post. `model_eval.R` contains the evaluation code. 

Note that if you want to run the code yourself, you will need to set up OpenAI and Anthropic API keys. You can learn more on the [ellmer package site](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/#authentication).
